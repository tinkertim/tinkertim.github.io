In fact,\\nyou\'ll probably want to set up rules for additional remote workers or even other offices\\nthat might interact with the sites like users would. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDepending on how you have Analytics configured (I suggest using Google Tag \\nManager; this tutorial assumes you are too), you probably don\'t load Analytics \\ncode while your site is running in development or staging mode. \\n\\nThis means you won\'t pollute your data by testing and doing development work, but \\ntag manager _will_ always hoist Analytics code when the site is in production mode, \\ncausing anything you do to count like you were a user. This isn\'t ideal, to say the\\nleast, and hard-coded IP filter hacks in your site\'s source code really smells. \\n\\nHere\'s how to deal with it using GA alone, step by step:\\n\\n### Step 1: Define An \\"internal\\" `traffic_type` For The Google Tag:\\n\\nThis, unfortunately, entails a lot of clicks. First, go to the Admin\\nsection of analytics:\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-1.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nNext, click on \\"Data Streams\\" and click on the site you want to modify\\non the right:\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-2.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nThen, scroll down to the \\"Google Tag\\" settings part of the site. Click on\\nthat:\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-3.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nThen click on \\"Configure Tag Settings\\":\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-4.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nOnce you\'ve done that, click on \\"Show All\\" (I _told_ you this was hidden):\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-5.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nNext, click on \\"Define Internal Traffic\\":\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-6.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nFinally! Create a new location, name it meainingfully, and provide IP addresses \\nindividually, or with a netmask (like if you want a whole /24 ignored). **Make \\nabsolutely sure that you save it! Note the save button in the top-right:**\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-7.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nPHEW. Need some coffee? Maybe you should go get some coffee or stretch out. I \\nkid really, it\'s not that bad unless you\'re a product manager.  \\n\\n### Step 2: The Filter Or Testing Mode\\n\\nThis is the easy part. Go back to the main admin route and this time, click on the \\n\\"Data Settings\\" icon, expand the little menu, and then click on the \\"Filters\\" link. You \\nwill see that Google so thoughtfully created the filter for you, even though they don\'t \\nshow you this functionality when you set it up.\\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-8.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\nClick on the filter and enable it. Make sure you save! You can set it to testing if you \\nwant, but that still makes reporting noisy unless you filter it out later, so I recommend\\njust turning it off right away. \\n\\n<img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-9.png\\" \\n    className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n    title=\\"Screenshot\\"\\n    alt=\\"Supplementary Screenshot\\"    \\n/>\\n\\n### Step 3: Wait A Few Hours, Then Test\\n\\nGoogle says it can take a while for changes to be applied to all recent data (which seems\\nto be the case in my experience), but you will notice that it almost immediately stops all\\nlogging from the addresses you provided. Confirm this by hitting production links from a \\nlocation that you squelched. \\n\\n### Closing\\n\\nI think Google should simplify this process, including providing a better tool to \\nlook up your own IP address. This is a great example use case for filters in general, and \\nyou probably noticed there\'s a lot more that you can do with them. \\n\\nThis easy enough to add to your setup checklist, now that you know where it lives. I hope you \\nfound this useful!"},{"id":"you-need-a-community-newsletter","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/you-need-a-community-newsletter","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-06-01-you-need-a-community-newsletter/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-01-you-need-a-community-newsletter/index.mdx","title":"Yes, You Need A Community Newsletter.

Well, maybe there is one excuse: not knowing what to write about. I can help \\nthere; let\'s talk about a bunch of stuff you can do when you really don\'t have great witty \\nideas to send out.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nHow you structure your community digest is up to you. Once a community reaches more than 50\\npeople, I like to have a _community specific_ newsletter that I launch just for community-related\\nupdates. It\'s a great way to focus engagement on things in an easy, relaxed way and a great way\\nto keep community satisfaction high.\\n\\nI try to keep community newsletters speific to _community_ news, even though that\'s frequently going\\nto overlap with some product news, I like to keep the product stuff to the primary newsletter that \\nthe investors and everyone else gets. \\n\\nHere\'s some ideas for what can go in your community newsletter perennially, or just as-needed when you\\ndon\'t have enough other content to really justify sending something out:\\n\\n### Spotlight Heroes & Welcome Nominations\\n\\nSet a high threshold for this so it\'s a big deal when someone crosses it, but make sure you keep track\\nof the effort people are putting in, and when they really crush something or go above and beyond, shine\\na light on them by telling the story to everyone else.\\n\\nReach out to the person in advance because this kind of spotlight can be uncomfortable for  \\nsome, and make sure people know you are interested in hearing about other instances that should \\nbe celebrated. \\n\\n### \\"Leak\\" Some Inside Info\\n\\nEveryone loves an inside scoop. Could your product team occasionally provide some screen shots or \\nother teasers so your community occasionally gets early access? It\'s a great way to get early feedback, \\nmake people feel special, and make sure there\'s something interesting for them to read about. \\n\\n### Interview A Developer Or PM\\n\\nI once maintained a newsletter where in each issue, we would ask the community to send some questions for \\none of our product managers as we published the answers to the questions posted the previous week. This was\\na great two-way conduit for our product team with me as a sort of filter and go-between and was a favorite \\npart of the newsletter.\\n\\nYou might find that, upon asking around, other employees might have great insights or topics to share with your \\ncommunity as employees see that other interviews are received positively and appreciated. \\n\\n### Adopt A PR\\n\\nSome pull requests represent a great deal of work and care, but need someone else to care about them a little \\nbefore they can be accepted. It\'s super helpful, extremely welcoming, and very empowering to the whole community.\\n\\nIt\'s helpful if you organize outreach to receive nominations for these, with self-nominations being explicitly \\nencouraged. Similarly, offer to help maintainers of projects that your community cares about find new contributors, \\nor even new maintainers entirely if necessary.\\n\\nA little facilitating can get you a lot of goodwill. \\n\\n### Community Blog Posts & Call For Submissions\\n\\nIt\'s great when people who don\'t work at your company write about your product. Make sure your community knows you\'ll\\nsyndicate posts they write and tell you about in your main newsletter, even if they aren\'t 100% flattering. It\'s also \\ngreat if you reach out to community authors when you have paid writing work available.\\n\\nNever offer to pay people with exposure, but giving exposure when they\'ve already done something awesome is\\na great thing to do. \\n\\n### Hidden Prizes\\n\\nOnce in a while, deliver some completely spontaneous and random fun. Give stickers for those that participate in a \\"caption this\\" \\ncontest, or something else that just lets people be happy they opened your email. Make a meme or two. Feature your own poorly-drawn\\ncomic strip, as long as it\'s relevant to the community. \\n\\n### Let It Become Community-led\\n\\nThese are just ideas. The best newsletter is the one you produce based on feedback from your community. What matters is\\nthat you send it, send it consistently, and make sure you put some real attention toward making each issue valuable."},{"id":"explaining-priorities-improves-inclusion","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/explaining-priorities-improves-inclusion","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-05-31-explaining-priorities-for-inclusive-leadership/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-31-explaining-priorities-for-inclusive-leadership/index.mdx","title":"How To Set Inclusive Priorities For Communities","description":"Writing about priorities is more effective and inclusive when approached from a results-oriented perspective.

Here are thoughts on how and when to communicate priorities more effectively AND inclusively.\\"\\n        alt=\\"Why Some Priorities Should Be Explained (designer text)\\"    \\n    />\\n</a>\\n\\nAnd this, my colleagues, is because it\'s sometimes *really* tricky to get other\\npeople to share your sense for how important something is, even when they say it is. \\nWhether it\'s finally getting someone to schedule a demo or getting people to attend \\na webinar, we generally do a not-great job of helping them know why their life just \\nwon\'t be as great if they deprioritize our thing. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Humans Are Often Unaware Of How They (re-) Prioritize.\\n\\nThe `tl;dr` of it is simply that people don\'t prioritize things the same way, and since\\nour organic brains do it with lots of [branch prediction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array),\\npeople aren\'t always cognizant when they de-prioritize a task or even their rationalization \\nfor why something else is important; they do it because their brain _knew_ it could rationalize \\nit, and sent them some dopamine just to make them feel a-okay about your hackathon entry deadline \\nflying right by. \\n\\nIf they knew that the order with their trophy would get all screwed up because they weren\'t \\non the correct spreadsheet in time, they might not have decided to play another round of Mario \\nKart.\\n\\nPrioritization among neurodivergent folks can take on even more levels, and understanding \\npriorities differently is one of the biggest causes of spats in open source communities. \\n\\n### We Often Stink When It Comes To Calling Others To Action\\n\\nHow we sort consequences from \\"scariest thing ever\\" to \\"meh\\" has a lot to do with what we \\ntend to let go of when we need to allocate more focus to a single task. If we think that \\nthe deadline for [X] is arbitrary, some organic CPUs will de-prioritize it in the background\\nwithout even telling the user, causing them to forget it entirely.\\n\\nGetting to the WIIFM quickly is critical if you want to get something on people\'s radar,\\nespecially people that have highly interrupt-driven jobs. But that\'s not always enough\\nto make them appropriately cognizant of keeping the plate high enough in the air. WIIFM \\nis an acronym for *\\"What\'s In It For Me?\\"*, if you didn\'t know.\\n\\n### To Convey Importance, Consider Stating The Results First\\n\\nConsider the following two sentences:\\n\\n> *\\"Please send your bio no later than August 15.\\"*\\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n> *\\"If you want your name printed on the prize, we need your bio by August 15.\\"*\\n\\n\\nBoth sentences are professional. The top sentence is laconic and polite, but it\'s also not\\nvery effective. People _will_ wait until days before the event to send it in because they \\naren\'t thinking about contest fulfillment. \\n\\nThe second sentence starts with a preposition, which helps snap out of someone glazing \\nover the text. It doesn\'t begin with Please because the word often causes people\'s \\neyes to glaze back over. We\'re polite, but not easily scrolled past. \\n\\nFinally, the sentence conveys a real consequence which will tie not getting the bio in time\\nto a sense of disappointment, making it WAY less likely to get optimized away by the human organic\\ncompiler. \\n\\n### It Matters In Feedback, Too!\\n\\nHere are two more sentences, but coming from a user from a perspective of wanting a new \\nfeature:\\n\\n> *\\"Please implement raw markdown mode.\\"*\\n\\nGreat. Straight. To the point, but it\'s not going to get the product team to alter the way\\nthey currently have this prioritized, or give any indication of what would happen if they \\nwaited 120 days or more to do it. \\n\\n> *\\"When raw markdown is enabled, I can clear out our queue faster and get more of my team on board with adopting [product].\\"*\\n\\nThis is better for the same reasons that we saw in the first example, but you\'ve effectively:\\n\\n - Broke the reader out of \\"scroll mode\\"\\n - Described an ideal outcome in a self-empowering way\\n\\nThe scenario is just an example, and you can\'t always use titles in this way, but you get\\nthe general idea. \\n\\n### Mutually-shared Priorities Result In Healthier Communities\\n\\nThis really goes without saying, but you\'d be surprised how much paying attention to this when \\ncrafting CTAs can improve your engagemnt across the board: internal to external, and external \\nto internal. It helps neurodivergent people feel valued and considered, and results in better\\noverall communication."},{"id":"community-software","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/community-software","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-04-09-community-software/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-community-software/index.mdx","title":"Embrace The Bike Shed!

I once had a coworker\\nwho said the best color for the bike shed is _fire_. I agree, _usually_, but they can be useful\\nthings in community dynamics. \\n\\nThere are two things that I really want you to know when it comes to initially fostering a new community:\\n\\n 1. The organism, especially an online organism, [will do whatever it damn well pleases](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/968276). I\'m not kidding.\\n 2. Your choice of what software to use should be ultimately decided by users, after being initially \\n driven by user journey stories.\\n\\nIf you understand both of those things, you might also say that this \\nseems a _little_ over-simplified to you, and you\'re not wrong, but I\'ll do \\nmy best to explain it in less than five minutes:\\n\\n<a href=\\"/blog/community-software/\\">\\n    <img \\n        src=\\"/img/blog/community-software/community-growth-og.png\\" \\n        className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n        title=\\"Communities Like Making Their Own Decisions\\"\\n        alt=\\"Artwork representing a community\\"    \\n    />\\n</a>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Drive And Protect Growth; Don\'t Try To Control It Too Much\\n\\nWild idea: Let your community decide on the software it wants so that you\'re free to build \\nthings that will delight them. Isn\'t that reflective of why you wanted a community in the \\nfirst place?\\n\\nWhat if it was _just_ your job to evaluate what\'s out there so you can rule any clear deal-breakers \\nout in conversations, and up to your community to decide on what it wants? For instance, let users \\nknow that you require any vendor to be SOC-2 certified with all of the proper GDPR tooling. \\n\\nI know what you\'re going to say: you\'ll need some kind of platform in order to even get that much\\ngoing, but that means we\'re now thinking on the same page! Use whatever works for _you_ in the\\nvery early instance, because it\'s critical that _you_ have a constant presence in the community \\nearly-on:\\n\\n - You need to **be there full time initially** to deal with naysayers, spam, and have a voice with a \\n vision. You\'re the butler, the host, and the entertainment. \\n\\n - You then need to **guard for question repitition**. The minute you see it, launch a discussion\\n about where Q&A should happen so that people don\'t get exhausted answering the same \\n questions over and over again. \\n\\nI\'ve watched developer communities die slow agonzing deaths in Slack channels because founders\\nstopped at this very first step, and checked out until they could hire someone to do that. \\n\\n***In my experience, \\"false starts\\" can be extremely toxic to future attempts fostering a community.*** Don\'t\\nbegin this process until you\'re ready to have it on your plate and eat it, too. \\n\\nThen, just like in a garden, you let the plants run the show while you establish new boundaries \\nand help move things around as needed to suppor their growth. That\'s the farthest I take the metaphor, \\nthough; when you\'re talking details about nurturing communities you need real KPIs, not metaphors.\\n\\n### Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\\n\\nIf you don\'t know what a user journey story is, you might be a little ahead of things by looking at\\na community right now. A user journey story is a narrative that you create which, to the \\nbest of your ability, reflects every detail of how people will find the thing you\'re building, \\nand why they\'ll want to use it. \\n\\nHere\'s a fictitious ancient user story someone could have written about [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), \\nfor example, back when it was rapidly-overtaking [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) as the version control system of \\nchoice before Git:\\n\\n> *April is a senior developer at FuzzyWuzzy, and was tired of always e-mailing their \\n> code updates in `.tgz` format even though the company used CVS, because it was so \\n> difficult to use. They searched around and found Subversion was easier to use and \\n> offered support beyond mailing lists.* \\n\\nSo in this ancient example, we might, say, launch an IRC channel where we invite some\\npeople to see if we can make some community magic happen, and use that channel to \\ncoordinate launching something more useful and appropriate based on actual needs that\\npeople communicate, not guesswork.\\n\\n### But, Tim, Isn\'t There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\\n\\nI have favorite wrenches, too, but I don\'t use them when I should be holding a lufa sponge, \\nyou know?\\n\\nYes, you need to treat your community as something that has the same observability as any other \\nimportant thing - and there are thankfully great choices for that. There\'s also great community \\nplatforms popping up all the time. \\n\\nYour community will develop features of its own through process if you don\'t implement it \\nin software, so you might as well give them the largest seat at the table of what\'s being \\nused.\\n\\n### Summing It Up:\\n\\nDon\'t get hung up on software if you want to start fostering a community around your \\nproduct. Instead, get busy working out all the ways you expect people to find your \\nproduct, determine some low-friction routes for folks using it to find eachother, \\nand be there to help them grow when _they\'re_ ready. Just make sure they know the \\ncriteria for an acceptable platform. \\n\\nBy doing it this way, you collaborate out of the gate and instill more trust, and the \\noptimal setup tends to find itself.

These well-orchestrated SPAs are great, in fact this blg post is being \\nbrought to you with one of them, but they\'re just that - static.\\n\\n<a href=\\"/blog/uses-for-edge-functions/\\">\\n    <img \\n        src=\\"/img/blog/uses-for-edge-functions/functions-og.png\\" \\n        className=\\"blogImage\\" \\n        alt=\\"Artwork representing functions\\"\\n        title=\\"Edge functions are all the rage. Good news is, they\'re actually useful, too!\\"\\n    />\\n</a>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nI used the Google link because the vendors are still figuring it out. This is all \\nstill kinda new, which is neat (IMHO).\\n\\nThere are enough places that provide usable \\"freemium tier\\" edge functions, some\\neven complete with storage, that hobbyists and open-source enthisiasts like me \\ncan build stuff and not need to pay a monthly bill for it. I might even package\\na few I\'m building around my own site, if I can think of a sensible way to \\"package\\"\\nthe serverless part of it. \\n\\nSo without further rambling, here\'s my list in no real order other than recall:\\n\\n### \\"Was this document helpful?\\" plugin for Docusaurus\\n\\nI have no desire to implement comments or anything else that would require moderation,\\nbut getting feedback about the relevancy and usefulness of all of your docs and \\nblog posts would be pretty super duper, right? \\n\\nEdge functions are great at handling all of the rate limiting and other stuff you\'d\\nwant to implement server-side, as well as an API to get stats from it. Many of them \\noffer some kind of storage option on the same physical network to store responses.\\n\\nThe caveat here is, you may or may not be able to access local storage and dependency\\nresolution / loading could be an obstacle. Anyway, I\'m kicking around the idea of \\nbuilding it if I can do it in a portable way manageably.\\n\\nI could probably get a V0 option for that done very quickly on Deno, but that kinda \\nmarries using the plugin to using Deno Deploy or someone that resold it. Not ideal.\\n\\n### My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\\n\\nIt\'s easy to run user engagement events in Discord when you have droids helping you \\nmanage it. Over the years, I\'ve found that self-service contests work extremely well\\nfor some of the same scenarios you might think about organizing a hackathon to boost.\\n\\nThe idea is, you let the user set their own definition of \\"done\\" for a project by \\nallowing the user to tell a bot that they\'re working on something, and then letting \\nthe bot know when the project was done by including a link or a screen shot. \\n\\nThe bot can then (do a hundred other things) including giving the person a QR code to\\nget their prize shipped, and then someone from the company can reach out if warranted.\\n\\nThis project actually illustrates how you have to think about GDPR ahead of everything\\nelse when you glue lots of stuff together like this, and there are indeed challenges\\nwith the Discord API at scale, but I believe it\'s a project that will work.\\n\\nI have a repo for this I\'ll dust off next month, maybe.\\n\\n### Client Side -> Edge Side Search\\n\\nFor really big sites, it would be interesting if the compiled client-side index used for\\nclient-side search could be just moved to an edge function upon deployment. It\'s not a \\nbad idea, though a little unconventional and prone to timing issues. \\n\\nThird-party search options are getting harder to get working (and more expensive) as the \\nproducts evolve, so this might be a neat hybrid approach. \\n\\n---\\n\\nAnyway, that\'s my list for the year, mostly around static sites. But I\'ve seen people doing\\nall kinds of interesting things from fully-blown functional CRON systems to raw data pipes\\nto worker farms to others - and there\'s plenty of freemium options, so it\'s a fun thing to \\nplay with."},{"id":"job-hunting","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/job-hunting","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-04-04-job-hunting-again/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-04-job-hunting-again/index.mdx","title":"I\'m Looking For A New Long-Term Adventure!","description":"I\'m winding down my contracting engagements in hope of getting full-time employment status again.
