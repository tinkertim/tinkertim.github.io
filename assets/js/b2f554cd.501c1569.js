I thought about it quite a\\nbit when it was touch-and-go if Twitter would stabilize again, and in all\\nfairness, that\'s still mostly the case.\\n\\nI also realized that I was leaking my own narrative, abut two hundred characters\\nat a time. Instead of writing the stories of my experiences coherently, with my\\nown purpose and vision, I was just adding short quips to the collective\\nnarrative. There\'s nothing wrong with adding to the collective, provided that\\nyou\'re writing your own version, too.\\n\\nSo, I had to do the thing I said I wasn\'t going to do again: I had to build yet\\nanother personal website. I didn\'t feel like getting a degree in hot new\\nframeworks, so I was originally going to go with Astro but Tailwind is just not\\ncomfortable for me for a personal project, so I ended up using:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\n... at least for now. I really want to play with Astro, as well as Fresh, but\\nthe ecosystems around both are pretty Tailwind-heavy for the time being.\\n\\nAnd for just a blog with a few static pages - Docusaurus is fine. I may even\\nbring back the docs and create some tutorials eventually, but the goal right now\\nis to just have a better professional presence."}]}')}}]);
