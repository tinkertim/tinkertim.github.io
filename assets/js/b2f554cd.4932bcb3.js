Long-term\\nsurvival is never a sure thing for anyone, but cancer survivors feel a lot \\nbetter every year after their fifth year of remission because even older \\nsurvival numbers go up and to the right afterward.\\n\\nBeing asked something like ...  _where do you see yourself in a few years?_ in \\nan interview no longer summons existential angst, which is a huge deal for me. \\nI can rationally see myself building something long-term, not just contributing \\nwhere I can to short-term needs while I waited to see how things went. \\n\\nI\'ve filled in my time by doing some contract work to meet our minimum expenses, \\nwhich has led me to amazing experiences I couldn\'t possibly have had otherwise. \\nHowever, I want to contribute more than just content assignments; I\'m not done \\nmaking my mark on DevRel. \\n\\nI\'ve been in language-agnostic roles for years; I helped to implement Stack Overflow\'s\\nnow famous remote-first work culture for the community growth team, I have \\noodles of management experience and I\'m a pretty darn nice guy. I\'ve also got \\na <a href=\\"/stack\\">pretty capable studio</a>. \\n\\n## So, What do I want to do?\\n\\nI want to help mentor the next age of DevRel pros. I want to bring everything I have \\nlearned from running the world\'s hugest developer community together with my love for \\nhelping people find their own voice and confidence on their feet. I want to direct \\ncontent, sure, but I want to teach others _how_ that process works. \\n\\nI also sorely miss the art of community building and management. And, well, I miss\\nlonger-term relationships in general, which feels a bit lacking when you\'re just \\nan outside contractor.  \\n\\n## What do I want out of it?\\n\\nWhat I need from an employer:\\n\\n - Remote-first culture\\n - Flexible time. For tons of reasons.\\n - Insurance that isn\'t a pain in the ass.\\n - Rapid / fast-pace is great, if we keep it to 50-ish hour weeks.\\n - Some kind of PTO program.\\n - Commitment to a long-term DevRel program. I can be a one-person band, \\n but my goal is to build and lead a team with actually different people.\\n\\nAs long as I can take breaks during the day and limit travel to a few times during\\nthe year, my disability needs are met.  \\n\\nDo you know someone? Please send them to me, or me to them!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-03-23-new-site/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-23-new-site/index.mdx","title":"New Site!

I thought about it quite a\\nbit when it was touch-and-go if Twitter would stabilize again, and in all\\nfairness, that\'s still mostly the case.\\n\\nI also realized that I was leaking my own narrative, abut two hundred characters\\nat a time. Instead of writing the stories of my experiences coherently, with my\\nown purpose and vision, I was just adding short quips to the collective\\nnarrative. There\'s nothing wrong with adding to the collective, provided that\\nyou\'re writing your own version, too.\\n\\nSo, I had to do the thing I said I wasn\'t going to do again: I had to build yet\\nanother personal website. I didn\'t feel like getting a degree in hot new\\nframeworks, so I was originally going to go with Astro but Tailwind is just not\\ncomfortable for me for a personal project, so I ended up using:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\n... at least for now. I really want to play with Astro, as well as Fresh, but\\nthe ecosystems around both are pretty Tailwind-heavy for the time being.\\n\\nAnd for just a blog with a few static pages - Docusaurus is fine. I may even\\nbring back the docs and create some tutorials eventually, but the goal right now\\nis to just have a better professional presence."}]}')}}]);
