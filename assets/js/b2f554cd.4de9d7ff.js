I need muscle relaxation without being \\nglued to a chair. I need serious help with pain and inflammation. I have debilitating anxiety. \\n\\nI also can\'t afford designer weed that comes in keepsake jars, which unfortunately really narrows my options for something that really meets\\nmy daytime needs. \\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/reviews/curio-sunny-wizard/curio-sunny-wizard.avif\\" className=\\"blogImage\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFor the longest time, only Miracle Alien Cookies really hit the spot. That\'s not to say that I don\'t like or use\\nother strains, in fact I love trying new things all the time, it\'s just that most daytime-appropriate\\nstrains only help with a few of my symptoms. \\n\\nI\'d tried Wizard Gum by Curio when I was looking for a nightcap, so when I saw other \\"day walkers\\" reviewing\\nthis sunny cross, I knew I needed to try it. I\'m glad that I did. I refer to anyone that consumes cannabis \\nwhile working as a day walker, in homage to the movie Blade. \\n\\n## Daytime Balance With Potency \\n\\nThe two most dominant terpenes are known for lending mental clarity, focus and creativity to the experience\\n(alpha pinene and limonene).\\n\\nNext, Beta Caryopheliene relieves inflammation, followed by the least of the significant terpenes in\\nthis strain, beta myrcene, providing relaxation and very mild sedation. \\n\\n```mermaid\\npie\\n    title Dominate Terpene Profile - Sunny Wizard By Curio Wellness\\n    \\"Alpha Pinene (Focus)\\" : 0.88\\n    \\"Limonene (Inspired)\\" : 0.65\\n    \\"Beta Caryopheliene (Anti-Inflmmatory)\\" : 0.47\\n    \\"Beta Myrcene (Relaxer)\\" : 0.27 \\n```\\nThere are other terpenes, too, it has a little linalool and humulene - [check it out on Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/brands/curio-wellness/products/curio-wellness-sunny-wizard-flower) where you can also figure\\nout where to buy it. It\'s strong enough to penetrate neuropathy, without putting you on the couch:\\n\\n| Cannabinoid | Amount |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| THC | 0.44% |\\n| THCa | 27.27% |\\n| CBD   | nil |\\n| CBGa  | 0.23% |\\n\\n### Hacking The Effects\\n\\nIf you want more relaxation (who doesn\'t want more couch occasionally anyway?) eat a mango an hour before using this strain. The \\nadditional beta myrcene you ingest will put you out promptly. \\n\\nThere\'s really no more room to tweak the \'up\' effects with this one as they\'re already at skyscraper levels, but\\nlemon will help refocus it.\\n\\n## A Formidable Pain Killer\\n\\nI not only have inflammatory issues from my immune system, I also have the problem of constant spasms ever since \\nI had my second round of brain surgery. These spasms frequently become cramps, which really effects my ability\\nto work. Usually, I have to look to stronger indica-leaning strains to get enough relief from this to be functional,\\nand mix in strong citrus strains to counteract the couching. \\n\\nThis strain is all of that done for me, balanced completely. I feel the muscles relax, but not give up for the day.\\n\\n## ADHD Soothing\\n\\nThe amount of Alpha Pinene in this strain makes sure you stay bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and it is a renewable \\neffect (you can sustain it through micro-dosing throughout the day).\\n\\nYou feel the effect start to take hold in the back of your head, near your language center, and that\'s when the relaxation\\nstarts. Then, you feel like you can get things done, similar to lifter. \\n\\n## Great Citrus-y Taste\\n\\nThe taste has lots of citrus with a hint of diesel and the aroma is actually somewhat subtle. It\'s not harsh, but like\\nother strans high in Beta Caryopheliene, it can tickle the throat. It doesn\'t have a chem-like taste like pop rocks, \\nbut your tongue will feel it. \\n\\n## Sunny Wizard By Curio Is Awesome!\\n\\nGreat any-time theraputic that hits what some have to chase multiple strains to manage, with a reasonably accessible price\\nand great flavor. I\'m definitely putting this in my rotation when I can get it deli style at my local dispensary."},{"id":"community-software","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/community-software","editUrl":"https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-04-09-community-software/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-community-software/index.mdx","title":"Embrace The Bike Shed!

I once had a coworker\\nwho said the best color for the bike shed is _fire_. I agree, _usually_, but they can be useful\\nthings in community dynamics. \\n\\nThere are two things that I really want you to know when it comes to initially fostering a new community:\\n\\n 1. The organism, especially an online organism, [will do whatever it damn well pleases](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/968276). I\'m not kidding.\\n 2. Your choice of what software to use should be ultimately decided by users, after being initially \\n driven by user journey stories.\\n\\nIf you understand both of those things, you might also say that this \\nseems a _little_ over-simplified to you, and you\'re not wrong, but I\'ll do \\nmy best to explain it in less than five minutes:\\n\\n![Community Growth](./community-growth-og.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Drive And Protect Growth; Don\'t Try To Control It Too Much\\n\\nWild idea: Let your community decide on the software it wants so that you\'re free to build \\nthings that will delight them. Isn\'t that reflective of why you wanted a community in the \\nfirst place?\\n\\nWhat if it was _just_ your job to evaluate what\'s out there so you can rule any clear deal-breakers \\nout in conversations, and up to your community to decide on what it wants? For instance, let users \\nknow that you require any vendor to be SOC-2 certified with all of the proper GDPR tooling. \\n\\nI know what you\'re going to say: you\'ll need some kind of platform in order to even get that much\\ngoing, but that means we\'re now thinking on the same page! Use whatever works for _you_ in the\\nvery early instance, because it\'s critical that _you_ have a constant presence in the community \\nearly-on:\\n\\n - You need to **be there full time initially** to deal with naysayers, spam, and have a voice with a \\n vision. You\'re the butler, the host, and the entertainment. \\n\\n - You then need to **guard for question repitition**. The minute you see it, launch a discussion\\n about where Q&A should happen so that people don\'t get exhausted answering the same \\n questions over and over again. \\n\\nI\'ve watched developer communities die slow agonzing deaths in Slack channels because founders\\nstopped at this very first step, and checked out until they could hire someone to do that. \\n\\n***In my experience, \\"false starts\\" can be extremely toxic to future attempts fostering a community.*** Don\'t\\nbegin this process until you\'re ready to have it on your plate and eat it, too. \\n\\nThen, just like in a garden, you let the plants run the show while you establish new boundaries \\nand help move things around as needed to suppor their growth. That\'s the farthest I take the metaphor, \\nthough; when you\'re talking details about nurturing communities you need real KPIs, not metaphors.\\n\\n### Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\\n\\nIf you don\'t know what a user journey story is, you might be a little ahead of things by looking at\\na community right now. A user journey story is a narrative that you create which, to the \\nbest of your ability, reflects every detail of how people will find the thing you\'re building, \\nand why they\'ll want to use it. \\n\\nHere\'s a fictitious ancient user story someone could have written about [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), \\nfor example, back when it was rapidly-overtaking [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) as the version control system of \\nchoice before Git:\\n\\n> *April is a senior developer at FuzzyWuzzy, and was tired of always e-mailing their \\n> code updates in `.tgz` format even though the company used CVS, because it was so \\n> difficult to use. They searched around and found Subversion was easier to use and \\n> offered support beyond mailing lists.* \\n\\nSo in this ancient example, we might, say, launch an IRC channel where we invite some\\npeople to see if we can make some community magic happen, and use that channel to \\ncoordinate launching something more useful and appropriate based on actual needs that\\npeople communicate, not guesswork.\\n\\n### But, Tim, Isn\'t There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\\n\\nI have favorite wrenches, too, but I don\'t use them when I should be holding a lufa sponge, \\nyou know?\\n\\nYes, you need to treat your community as something that has the same observability as any other \\nimportant thing - and there are thankfully great choices for that. There\'s also great community \\nplatforms popping up all the time. \\n\\nYour community will develop features of its own through process if you don\'t implement it \\nin software, so you might as well give them the largest seat at the table of what\'s being \\nused.\\n\\n### Summing It Up:\\n\\nDon\'t get hung up on software if you want to start fostering a community around your \\nproduct. Instead, get busy working out all the ways you expect people to find your \\nproduct, determine some low-friction routes for folks using it to find eachother, \\nand be there to help them grow when _they\'re_ ready. Just make sure they know the \\ncriteria for an acceptable platform. \\n\\nBy doing it this way, you collaborate out of the gate and instill more trust, and the \\noptimal setup tends to find itself. Just make sure you\'re there to follow through, \\nbe the face and voice, and executue on what they decide along with you.\\n\\nMaybe four minutes. Okay it was probably five.

Many of them \\noffer some kind of storage option on the same physical network to store responses.\\n\\nThe caveat here is, you may or may not be able to access local storage and dependency\\nresolution / loading could be an obstacle. Anyway, I\'m kicking around the idea of \\nbuilding it if I can do it in a portable way manageably.\\n\\nI could probably get a V0 option for that done very quickly on Deno, but that kinda \\nmarries using the plugin to using Deno Deploy or someone that resold it. Not ideal.\\n\\n### My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\\n\\nIt\'s easy to run user engagement events in Discord when you have droids helping you \\nmanage it. Over the years, I\'ve found that self-service contests work extremely well\\nfor some of the same scenarios you might think about organizing a hackathon to boost.\\n\\nThe idea is, you let the user set their own definition of \\"done\\" for a project by \\nallowing the user to tell a bot that they\'re working on something, and then letting \\nthe bot know when the project was done by including a link or a screen shot. \\n\\nThe bot can then (do a hundred other things) including giving the person a QR code to\\nget their prize shipped, and then someone from the company can reach out if warranted.\\n\\nThis project actually illustrates how you have to think about GDPR ahead of everything\\nelse when you glue lots of stuff together like this, and there are indeed challenges\\nwith the Discord API at scale, but I believe it\'s a project that will work.\\n\\nI have a repo for this I\'ll dust off next month, maybe.\\n\\n### Client Side -> Edge Side Search\\n\\nFor really big sites, it would be interesting if the compiled client-side index used for\\nclient-side search could be just moved to an edge function upon deployment. It\'s not a \\nbad idea, though a little unconventional and prone to timing issues. \\n\\nThird-party search options are getting harder to get working (and more expensive) as the \\nproducts evolve, so this might be a neat hybrid approach. \\n\\n---\\n\\nAnyway, that\'s my list for the year, mostly around static sites.
