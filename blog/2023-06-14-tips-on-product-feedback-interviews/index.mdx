Conducting a productive 1:1 product feedback session is difficult. In fact, there's 
an art to running them that isn't obvious to the inexperienced, which I quickly discovered 
when I first sat down with someone to talk about their experience on a new site called 
Stack Overflow years ago.  

This post contains most of what I wished I knew back then, condensed into a ten minute 
read.

If you're just skimming, there's one thing I ***really hope*** you'll take away today: 
**product interviews are harder than they seem on the surface to pull off well**. If the person
doing the interview hasn't done an enormous amount of prep first, including sitting in on other 
people doing interviews, they can go from fun to awful really quickly.

I'm assuming that you have some kind of community or developer portal that shows people where to 
go depending on what they need, and that you have some kind of analytics running there that shows 
you where you have pockets of users geographically. This leads us to ...

### Location, Location, Location!

You'll need to know where you should locate yourself in order to maximize being convenient to 
users in-person, or know which time zones you'll have to optimize for in order to conduct these 
virtually. Either way, you need this data.

If you are friends with a company that markets to the same kinds of developers that you need to 
reach, you could ask them for some advice if you don't have enough meaningful data yourself. But 
I have to warn you: if you're so young that you still don't have this, you might not be ready for 
these interviews yet. Keep reading nonetheless, but that could be your gut trying to tell you 
something. 

Don't expect people to come to you, even if you sweeten the deal with gift cards. Inertia costs
way more than $50 for many developers to overcome. 

### Understand Each User's Conversational Needs

I'm assuming you have a privacy policy and an event code of conduct. Don't proceed if either are 
lacking, it would be a major trust and safety issue. 

Here are some things that are helpful to collect in advance from people who volunteer to be
interviewed:

 - Person's background with the product and how they use it (work, hobby, etc)
 - If any accommodations need to be met, including any accessibility concerns. 
 - Any social media links that they'd like shared with you and the product team
 - A free-form "anything else" box.

Make sure this info is collected in a way that works with your company's privacy policy and 
data retention policies.

### Understand Each User's Stake & Goals

You will be meeting with a human who may or may not:

 - Feel a little star struck
 - Be in a *massive* hurry to tell you about one or two particular things before they forget
 - Be extroverted
 - Be on-time
 - Be nervous
 - Be typical in any way at all 

The best thing you can do is open with *"Hi I'm [you] and I'm the [title] at [company]. Everyone calls 
me [name] and refers to me as he or him. Your timing is absolutely perfect! Before we get started, is 
there anything you want to make sure we have time to talk about, or anything you need to talk about 
before we begin the interview?"*

You know *your* goals for this interview. To make the experience as fruitful for the user as possible, 
use your interviewing super powers to make sure they know *their* goals, too!

This should put everyone at a bit more ease because you can focus on the conversation now that the 
outcome goals have been charted. This also keeps the smalltalk positive, because nobody is apologizing 
for running late or feeling like they look a mess. 

Let them know that there will be time to ask questions at the end. Remember that recording requires
consent, and you should get a signed release even if you record the consent (DocuSign FTW)

### Practicing Your Presence Is Key

You can't throw an interview together on a flight. If you don't try this and practice
it with a few people that actually know how the thing is supposed to work, things might 
not go very well. 

I am the last person to underestimate someone's ability to accomplish magnificent things 
at the very last minute - that's how I sometimes work too! And as someone that thrives when 
the dopamine can actually keep up, I'm telling you it's going to take longer than you think.

A user interview is almost like a demo that you have to make a trainee do for you, with the 
patience of a saint. As long as you know what you're up against, you do you. 

### Optimize For The User's Time (In General, And For Speaking)

Normally, in an interview, you want the person being *interviewed* to be the primary 
speaker in a transcript, with the interviewer confined to short, broadly-comprehensible questions.

This means 85% of the talking should be the user, 10% the interviewer, and 5% the muffled junk 
and long silences that you edit out.

You'll find this a balancing act between injecting just enough anecdotes to keep the conversation 
flowing, but make sure it's to get _their_ story re-started, not to tell yours to completion.

### Reiterate The User's Key Points Frequently

Three French hens, two turtle doves and repetition does wonder for the brain! Not only does the 
user hear you continually reiterate things that they agree with _because they said them_, it helps 
them (and you) make sure trains of thoughts pas smoothly straight to the kaboose. 

Imagine each main point that the user makes as a separate plate. Each detail about that is a serving
of something on that plate. Good waiters do this in their heads, you can learn how too, but that takes
a lot of time.

There are tips at the end of the post on how to manage this.

### Understand The Halo Effect 

***Don't Be Right, Be A Successful Interviewer!***

There's a strong bias in engineering culture that makes some of us -- okay, *most* of us --
feel as if we're already qualified to be a junior engineer in every other field of engineering 
once we've come really far in another.

There's _just enough_ merit to that silly notion that it causes us to think we've completely 
figured out how everything else in the world _surely_ works, and causes us to offer advice, often 
unsolicited, on how to improve things.

So when users in interviews tell you stuff like _"and by the way, if you just frob the pulse normalizers, 
you'll be able to scale much better!"_ just smile and write it down, even if you don't use whatever
it is that they think you can improve. 

The point is, it's about harvesting, not planting. Of course you should correct major misinformation or 
rumor or other things, but save the good fights for the product team themselves.

### Practice Belaying Bewilderment (Yes, You Read That Correctly)

I once observed a designer that had a unique disposition in regards to their shift keys: they only
ever touched them when caps lock wouldn't accomplish the goal. 

This means:

> Hello, World!

Was typed as:

> `<caps lock>H</caps lock>+e+l+l+o+,+ <caps lock>W</caps lock>+o+r+l+d+<shift>1</shift>`

And for the next 75 minutes, ***they were going to be hand-coding HTML, JS and CSS right in front 
of me***. 

My reaction was visceral, to say the least, but my curiosity kicked in quickly. It turned out 
to be really cool that I could watch this very unique work flow, and I just observed. I knew 
I'd need a day or two to process what I'd actually learned from watching them, and that was fine.

But there are more things where you have to have a reflex to suppress reactions that, unless managed,
tend to be expressed quite viscerally, without adequate filtering. Hold yourself to where you needed 
others to be when you were the one that was different.

It takes practice. 

### Consider These Helpful Accessories & Supplies: 

This is my standard gear for doing in-person interviews, the only difference in doing them remotely 
is that recording is usually more convenient, and you're likely using some kind of shared document 
and doodle space instead of an actual table between you. 

The last one is optional, of course, and more of an incentive to get people to interrupt their day 
to talk to you.

#### Vox Recorders

I carry [this small digital recorder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083P5C2Q4/) for every day 
note taking, which is also an ideal recorder for in-person interviews. It has two features that 
make it especially well-suited to the task:

 1. Instant-record functionality from the off position. I flip a switch upwards and in 15 seconds 
 I'm confident that a recording is going. 

 2. It accepts a standard 3/8" TRS cable as input, which allows for mobile recording with quality
 mics anywhere, using a [small black box like this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QRZ77QN/)

 3. Easy-peasey USB-C fetching of mp3 output which you can set up to dump to your transcription 
 service of choice. 

#### Table / Whiteboard Space W / Sticky Notes As Visual Aides

During in-person interviews, I use the space between myself and the interviewee as a collaborative, 
fungible medium. Rather than gesture in the air, I capture individual ideas that I want to explore
in sticky notes, and keep re-ordering and updating them as the conversation flows. 

I like using colored Red, Yellow and Green notes specifically to capture problematic, neutral or 
commendable experiences, as the user related them. This idea branches from something called a 
friction log, which a former PM colleague named Megan Risdal introduced me to.

I've used her very elegant and simple system ever since.

#### Document Friction Logs

Much like the sticky notes above, you can use red, green and yellow coloring in shared documents.

    className="blogImage" 
    title="The simplest thing ever!"
    alt="Screen Shot Of A Google Doc"    
/>

I like to type notes as the user is talking (being careful to remain attentive to what they're 
saying) and highlight / change text color as an activity with the user. I can always fill out the
text more from the recording, what's important is capturing high-level things and getting the color 
coding correct while the user is with you. 

#### Beep! Not A Robot

Never underestimate the nerd factor in motivation. At Stack Overflow, we implemented a special badge 
that could only be earned by attending an event and scanning a QR code that was linked to the event.

It was called "Not A Robot" as a play on the captcha phrasing. 

<img 
    src="/img/blog/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/not-a-robot.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Beep Boo Beep!"
    alt="Screen Shot Of Not A Robot Badge"    
/>

There were guard rails in place to make sure the badge didn't become too easy to get just by knowing 
some employees, and it proved to be a significant motivator for people who were considering attending 
one of our live events. 

### Concluding 

I hope you found some value in what I've shared here, and I hope you also feel more excited and 
inspired when it comes to forming close connections with people that use what you create and promote. 

Adding truly effective user sessions to your product feedback loops will more than pay for the 
amount of prep that they require, and I think you'll find, really deserve. If you feel like you're 
burning out a bit, why not go hit a city where lots of users are and spend time with humans that 
really care about your work? 

It would be very hard to have an uninspiring experience, especially if you're prepared.
