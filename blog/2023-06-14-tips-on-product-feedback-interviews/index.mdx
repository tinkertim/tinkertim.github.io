Conducting a productive 1:1 product feedback session is difficult. In fact, there's 
an art to running them that isn't obvious to the inexperienced, which I quicky discovered 
when I first sat down with someone to talk about their experience on this new site called 
Stack Overflow! 

This post contains most of what I wished I knew back then, condensed into a five minute 
read.

If you're just skimming, there's one thing I ***really hope*** you'll take away today: 
**product interviews are harder than they seem on the surface to pull off well**. If the person
doing the interview hasn't done an enormous amount of prep first, including sitting in on other 
people doing interviews, they can go from fun to awful really quickly.

I'm assuming that you have some kind of community or developer portal that shows people where to 
go depending on what they need, and that you have some kind of analytics running there that shows 
you where you have pockets of users geographically. This leads us to ...

### Location, Locatoin, Location!

You'll need to know where you should locate yourself in order to maximize being convenient to 
users in-person, or know which time zones you'll have to optimize for in order to conduct these 
virtually. Either way, you need this data.

If you are friends with a company that markets to the same kinds of developers that you need to 
reach, you could ask them for some advice if you don't have enough meaningful data yourself. But 
I have to warn you: if you're so young that you still don't have this, you might not be ready for 
these interviews yet. Keep reading nonetheless, but that could be your gut trying to tell you 
something. 

Don't expect people to come to you, even if you sweeten the deal with gift cards. Inertia costs
way more than $50 for many developers to overcome. 


### Understand The User's Stake

You will be meeting with a person who may or may not:

 - Feel a little star struck
 - Be in a *massive* hurry to tell you about one or two particular things before they forget
 - Be extroverted
 - Be on-time
 - Be nervous
 - Be in any way typical 

The best thing you can do is open with *"Hi I'm [you] and you could not have timed that any better! 
Before we get started, is there anything you want to make sure we have time to talk about, or anything 
you need to talk about before we begin the interview?"*

This should put everyone at a bit more ease, and help make sure everything gets captured. Your goal 
here is to get them to say something that they might otherwise forget rather than waste time on silly 
apologies for being a few minutes late or struggling with the audio.

Let them know that there will be time to ask questions at the end. Remember that recording requires
consent, and you should get a signed release even if you record the consent (DocuSign FTW)

### Practice That Shit

You can't throw an interview together on a flight. If you don't try this and practice
it with a few people that actually know how the thing is supposed to work, you'll provide
a rather poor experience. You know you best, but I thought I had it in the bag too. 

### Optimize For The User's Time (In General, And For Speaking)

Normally, in an interview, you want the person being *interviewed* to be the primary 
speaker in a transcript, with the interviewer confined to short, broadly-comprehensible questions.

This means 85% of the talking should be the user, 10% the interviewer, and 5% the muffled junk 
and long silences that you edit out.  

### Parrot Like The Twelve Days Of Christmas

(like in the opening sequence to a new episode in a new series, 
keep reiterating how we got 'here')

### Plan Patience Pit Stops Around The Halo Effect Prevalent In Engineering

(bias where engineers think that because they understand [x] engineering, 
that they must also understand [y, z and c])

### Practice Belaying Bewilderment (Yes, You Read That Correctly)
