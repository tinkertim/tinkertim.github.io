description: Google Analytics 4 has the ability to keep your own use from polluting your engagement data. Surprisingly, this functionality is hard-to-find. Here's how!

One of the most meaningful metrics for a documentation site is how long
the average "engaged" session tends to last. Put simply, the longer people
stay clicking around things could mean great or possibly even problematic
things depending on context, so you _always_ want that number to be as 
accurate as possible.

The thing is, your own early use of your site often pollutes engagement data 
at a really critical time; here's a tutorial on how to avoid that!

To get the most out of this short tutorial, make sure you have the IP addresses that 
your own use of your sites originates from handy, and about ten minutes of time. In fact,
you'll probably want to set up rules for additional remote workers or even other offices
that might interact with the sites like users would.

Depending on how you have Analytics configured (I suggest using Google Tag 
Manager; this tutorial assumes you are too), you probably don't load the Analytics 
code while the site is running in development or staging modes. This means
you don't pollute your data by testing and doing development work, but tag manager
_will_ always hoist Analytics code in production. 

This means, any time you do _anything_ that a normal visitor would do on your sites, 
you pollute metrics like average engagement time. This is not ideal at all. 

Here's how to deal with it, step by step:

### Step 1: Define An "internal" `traffic_type` For The Google Tag:

This, unfortunately, entails a lot of clicks. First, go to the Admin
section of analytics:

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-1.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Next, click on "Data Streams" and click on the site you want to modify
on the right:

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-2.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Then, scroll down to the "Google Tag" settings part of the site. Click on
that:

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-3.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Then click on "Configure Tag Settings":

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-4.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Once you've done that, click on "Show All" (I _told_ you this was hidden):

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-5.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Next, click on "Define Internal Traffic":

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-6.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Finally! Create a new location, name it meainingfully, and provide IP addresses 
individually, or with a netmask (like if you want a whole /24 ignored). **Make 
absolutely sure that you save it! Note the save button in the top-right:**

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-7.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

PHEW. Need some coffee? Maybe you should go get some coffee or stretch out. I 
kid really, it's not that bad unless you're a product manager.  

### Step 2: The Filter Or Testing Mode

This is the easy part. Go back to the main admin route and this time, click on the 
"Data Settings" icon, expand the little menu, and then click on the "Filters" link. You 
will see that Google so thoughtfully created the filter for you, even though they don't 
show you this functionality when you set it up.

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-8.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

Click on the filter and enable it. Make sure you save! You can set it to testing if you 
want, but that still makes reporting noisy unless you filter it out later, so I recommend
just turning it off right away. 

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-9.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="Screenshot"
    alt="Supplementary Screenshot"    
/>

### Step 3: Wait A Few Hours, Then Test

Google says it can take a while for changes to be applied to all recent data (which seems
to be the case in my experience), but you will notice that it almost immediately stops all
logging from the addresses you provided. Confirm this by hitting production links from a 
location that you squelched. 

### Closing

I think Google should simplify this process, including providing a better tool to 
look up your own IP address. This is a great example use case for filters in general, and 
you probably noticed there's a lot more that you can do with them. 

This easy enough to add to your setup checklist, now that you know where it lives. I hope you 
found this useful!
