I'm not sure who was the first person to speak the following sacred funnel
wisdom text, or even precisely how it was first conveyed, but it sounded 
something a lot like this:

> When troubleshooting funnels, never look for output at the end 
> of the funnel unless that's actually the next stage of the funnel.

Some of the most difficult funnels to "debug" are the ones that require busy
people to devote their full attention to something that you want to show them,
or have them participate in.

And this, my colleagues, is because it's sometimes *really* tricky to get other
people to share your sense for how important something is, even when they say it is. 
Whether it's finally getting someone to schedule a demo or getting people to attend 
a webinar, we generally do a not-great job of helping them know why their life just 
won't be as great if they deprioritize our thing.

### Humans Are Often Aware Of How They (re-) Prioritize.

The `tl;dr` of it is simply that people don't prioritize things the same way, and since
our organic brains do it with lots of [branch prediction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array),
people aren't always cognizant when they de-prioritize a task or even their rationalization 
for why something else is important; they do it because their brain _knew_ it could rationalize 
it, and sent them some dopamine just to make them feel a-okay about your hackathon entry deadline 
flying right by. 

If they knew that the order with their trophy would get all screwed up because they weren't 
on the correct spreadsheet in time, they might not have decided to play another round of Mario 
Kart.

Prioritization among neurodivergent folks can take on even more levels, and understanding 
priorities differently is one of the biggest causes of spats in open source communities. 

### We Often Stink When It Comes To Calling Others To Action

How we sort consequences from "scariest thing ever" to "meh" has a lot to do with what we 
tend to let go of when we need to allocate more focus to a single task. If we think that 
the deadline for [X] is arbitrary, some organic CPUs will de-prioritize it in the background
without even telling the user, causing them to forget it entirely.

Getting to the WIIFM quickly is critical if you want to get something on people's radar,
especially people that have highly interrupt-driven jobs. But that's not always enough
to make them appropriately cognizant of keeping the plate high enough in the air. 

### To Convey Importance, Consider Stating The Results First

Consider the following two sentences:

> *"Please send your bio no later than August 15."*

And:

> *"If you want your name printed on the prize, we need your bio by August 15."*


Both sentences are professional. The top sentence is laconic and polite, but it's also not
very effective. People _will_ wait until days before the event to send it in because they 
aren't thinking about contest fulfillment. 

The second sentence starts with a preposition, which helps snap out of someone glazing 
over the text. It doesn't begin with Please because the word often causes people's 
eyes to glaze back over. We're polite, but not easily scrolled past. 

Finally, the sentence conveys a real consequence which will tie not getting the bio in time
to a sense of disappointment, making it WAY less likely to get optimized away by the human organic
compiler. 

### It Matters In Feedback, Too!

Here are two more sentences, but coming from a user from a perspective of wanting a new 
feature:

> *"Please implement raw markdown mode."*

Great. Straight. To the point, but it's not going to get the product team to alter the way
they currently have this prioritized, or give any indication of what would happen if they 
waited 120 days or more to do it. 

> *"When raw markdown is enabled, I can clear out our queue faster and get more of my team on board with adopting [product]."*

This is better for the same reasons that we saw in the first example, but you've effectively:

 - Broke the reader out of "scroll mode"
 - Described an ideal outcome in a self-empowering way

The scenario is just an example, and you can't always use titles in this way, but you get
the general idea. 

### Mutually-shared Priorities Result In Healthier Communities

This really goes without saying, but you'd be surprised how much paying attention to this when 
crafting CTAs can improve your engagemnt across the board: internal to external, and external 
to internal. It helps neurodivergent people feel valued and considered, and results in better
overall communication.
