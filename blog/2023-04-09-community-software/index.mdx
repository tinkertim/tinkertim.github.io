_"What are we gonna use for [...]?"_ is always the best [bike shed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) question. I once had a coworker
who said the best color for the bike shed is _fire_. I agree, _usually_, but they can be useful
things in community dynamics. 

There are two things that I really want you to know when it comes to initially fostering a new community:

 1. The organism, especially an online organism, [will do whatever it damn well pleases](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/968276). I'm not kidding.
 2. Your choice of what software to use should be ultimately decided by users, after being initially 
 driven by user journey stories.

If you understand both of those things, you might also say that this 
seems a _little_ over-simplified to you, and you're not wrong, but I'll do 
my best to explain it in less than five minutes:

### Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much

Wild idea: Let your community decide on the software it wants so that you're free to build 
things that will delight them. Isn't that reflective of why you wanted a community in the 
first place?

What if it was _just_ your job to evaluate what's out there so you can rule any clear deal-breakers 
out in conversations, and up to your community to decide on what it wants? For instance, let users 
know that you require any vendor to be SOC-2 certified with all of the proper GDPR tooling. 

I know what you're going to say: you'll need some kind of platform in order to even get that much
going, but that means we're now thinking on the same page! Use whatever works for _you_ in the
very early instance, because it's critical that _you_ have a constant presence in the community 
early-on:

 - You need to **be there full time initially** to deal with naysayers, spam, and have a voice with a 
 vision. You're the butler, the host, and the entertainment. 

 - You then need to **guard for question repitition**. The minute you see it, launch a discussion
 about where Q&A should happen so that people don't get exhausted answering the same 
 questions over and over again. 

I've watched developer communities die slow agonzing deaths in Slack channels because founders
stopped at this very first step, and checked out until they could hire someone to do that. 

***In my experience, "false starts" can be extremely toxic to future attempts fostering a community.*** Don't
begin this process until you're ready to have it on your plate and eat it, too. 

Then, just like in a garden, you let the plants run the show while you establish new boundaries 
and help move things around as needed to suppor their growth. That's the farthest I take the metaphor, 
though; when you're talking details about nurturing communities you need real KPIs, not metaphors.

### Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories

If you don't know what a user journey story is, you might be a little ahead of things by looking at
a community right now. A user journey story is a narrative that you create which, to the 
best of your ability, reflects every detail of how people will find the thing you're building, 
and why they'll want to use it. 

Here's a fictitious ancient user story someone could have written about [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), 
for example, back when it was rapidly-overtaking [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) as the version control system of 
choice before Git:

> *April is a senior developer at FuzzyWuzzy, and was tired of always e-mailing their 
> code updates in `.tgz` format even though the company used CVS, because it was so 
> difficult to use. They searched around and found Subversion was easier to use and 
> offered support beyond mailing lists.* 

So in this ancient example, we might, say, launch an IRC channel where we invite some
people to see if we can make some community magic happen, and use that channel to 
coordinate launching something more useful and appropriate based on actual needs that
people communicate, not guesswork.

### But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?

I have favorite wrenches, too, but I don't use them when I should be holding a lufa sponge, 
you know?

Yes, you need to treat your community as something that has the same observability as any other 
important thing - and there are thankfully great choices for that. There's also great community 
platforms popping up all the time. 

Your community will develop features of its own through process if you don't implement it 
in software, so you might as well give them the largest seat at the table of what's being 
used.

### Summing It Up:

Don't get hung up on software if you want to start fostering a community around your 
product. Instead, get busy working out all the ways you expect people to find your 
product, determine some low-friction routes for folks using it to find eachother, 
and be there to help them grow when _they're_ ready. Just make sure they know the 
criteria for an acceptable platform. 

By doing it this way, you collaborate out of the gate and instill more trust, and the 
optimal setup tends to find itself. Just make sure you're there to follow through, 
be the face and voice, and executue on what they decide along with you.

Maybe four minutes. Okay it was probably five. But I hope you enjoyed reading!
