Did the whole Twitter shakeup make you stop and think about 
how much time you spend creating content on other people's 
platforms? I thought about it quite a bit when it was touch-and-go
if Twitter would stabilize again, and in all fairness, that's still 
mostly the case.

I also realized that I was leaking my own narrative, abut two hundred
characters at a time. Instead of writing the stories of my experiences
coherently, with my own purpose and vision, I was just adding short 
quips to the collective narrative. There's nothing wrong with adding to
the collective, provided that you're writing your own version, too.

So, I had to do the thing I said I wasn't going to do again: I had to build
yet another personal website. I didn't feel like getting a degree in 
hot new frameworks, so I was originally going to go with Astro but Tailwind
is just not comfortable for me for a personal project, so I ended up using:


![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)


... at least for now. I really want to play with Astro, as well as Fresh, 
but the ecosystems around both are pretty Tailwind-heavy for the time being.

And for just a blog with a few static pages - Docusaurus is fine. I may even
bring back the docs and create some tutorials eventually, but the goal right now is to just have a better professional presence.
