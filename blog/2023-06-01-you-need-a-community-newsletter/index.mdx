I used to be extremely anti-email. I still am, personally, but I no longer 
squint and try to point at my nose with my lips when someone mentions an email
drip campaign where software developers are the target audience. 

I think I'm also safe in saying that many people expect that they'll be subscribed
to _some_ kind of list when they join a new community, with an easy one-link / one-click 
way to opt-out, does that sound about right?

I guess that means there's no good excuse for not having a newsletter for your
online community. Well, maybe there is one excuse: not knowing what to write about. I can help 
there; let's talk about a bunch of stuff you can do when you really don't have great witty 
ideas to send out.

How you structure your community digest is up to you. Once a community reaches more than 50
people, I like to have a _community specific_ newsletter that I launch just for community-related
updates. It's a great way to focus engagement on things in an easy, relaxed way and a great way
to keep community satisfaction high.

I try to keep community newsletters speific to _community_ news, even though that's frequently going
to overlap with some product news, I like to keep the product stuff to the primary newsletter that 
the investors and everyone else gets. 

Here's some ideas for what can go in your community newsletter perennially, or just as-needed when you
don't have enough other content to really justify sending something out:

### Spotlight Heroes & Welcome Nominations

Set a high threshold for this so it's a big deal when someone crosses it, but make sure you keep track
of the effort people are putting in, and when they really crush something or go above and beyond, shine
a light on them by telling the story to everyone else.

Reach out to the person in advance because this kind of spotlight can be uncomfortable for  
some, and make sure people know you are interested in hearing about other instances that should 
be celebrated. 

### "Leak" Some Inside Info

Everyone loves an inside scoop. Could your product team occasionally provide some screen shots or 
other teasers so your community occasionally gets early access? It's a great way to get early feedback, 
make people feel special, and make sure there's something interesting for them to read about. 

### Interview A Developer Or PM

I once maintained a newsletter where in each issue, we would ask the community to send some questions for 
one of our product managers as we published the answers to the questions posted the previous week. This was
a great two-way conduit for our product team with me as a sort of filter and go-between and was a favorite 
part of the newsletter.

You might find that, upon asking around, other employees might have great insights or topics to share with your 
community as employees see that other interviews are received positively and appreciated. 

### Adopt A PR

Some pull requests represent a great deal of work and care, but need someone else to care about them a little 
before they can be accepted. It's super helpful, extremely welcoming, and very empowering to the whole community.

It's helpful if you organize outreach to receive nominations for these, with self-nominations being explicitly 
encouraged. Similarly, offer to help maintainers of projects that your community cares about find new contributors, 
or even new maintainers entirely if necessary.

A little facilitating can get you a lot of goodwill. 

### Community Blog Posts & Call For Submissions

It's great when people who don't work at your company write about your product. Make sure your community knows you'll
syndicate posts they write and tell you about in your main newsletter, even if they aren't 100% flattering. It's also 
great if you reach out to community authors when you have paid writing work available.

Never offer to pay people with exposure, but giving exposure when they've already done something awesome is
a great thing to do. 

### Hidden Prizes

Once in a while, deliver some completely spontaneous and random fun. Give stickers for those that participate in a "caption this" 
contest, or something else that just lets people be happy they opened your email. Make a meme or two. Feature your own poorly-drawn
comic strip, as long as it's relevant to the community. 

### Let It Become Community-led

These are just ideas. The best newsletter is the one you produce based on feedback from your community. What matters is
that you send it, send it consistently, and make sure you put some real attention toward making each issue valuable.
