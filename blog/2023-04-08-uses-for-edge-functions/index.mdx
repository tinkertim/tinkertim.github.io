title: Things I'm Thinking About Getting Edgy With
description: Everyone seems to want to use edge functions, but nobody knows quite what to do with them. Here's my current list of things I want to build this year.

[Edge functions](https://www.google.com/search?q=edge+functions) <sup><small>(<em>Google Link</em>)</small></sup> 
are really appealing to me because the majority of web work that I do involves some 
kind of documentation, which these days usually means using a static site generator 
of some sort. These well-orchestrated SPAs are great, in fact this blg post is being 
brought to you with one of them, but they're just that - static.

I used the Google link because the vendors are still figuring it out. This is all 
still kinda new, which is neat (IMHO).

There are enough places that provide usable "freemium tier" edge functions, some
even complete with storage, that hobbyists and open-source enthisiasts like me 
can build stuff and not need to pay a monthly bill for it. I might even package
a few I'm building around my own site, if I can think of a sensible way to "package"
the serverless part of it. 

So without further rambling, here's my list in no real order other than recall:

### "Was this document helpful?" plugin for Docusaurus

I have no desire to implement comments or anything else that would require moderation,
but getting feedback about the relevancy and usefulness of all of your docs and 
blog posts would be pretty super duper, right? 

Edge functions are great at handling all of the rate limiting and other stuff you'd
want to implement server-side, as well as an API to get stats from it. Many of them 
offer some kind of storage option on the same physical network to store responses.

The caveat here is, you may or may not be able to access local storage and dependency
resolution / loading could be an obstacle. Anyway, I'm kicking around the idea of 
building it if I can do it in a portable way manageably.

I could probably get a V0 option for that done very quickly on Deno, but that kinda 
marries using the plugin to using Deno Deploy or someone that resold it. Not ideal.

### My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)

It's easy to run user engagement events in Discord when you have droids helping you 
manage it. Over the years, I've found that self-service contests work extremely well
for some of the same scenarios you might think about organizing a hackathon to boost.

The idea is, you let the user set their own definition of "done" for a project by 
allowing the user to tell a bot that they're working on something, and then letting 
the bot know when the project was done by including a link or a screen shot. 

The bot can then (do a hundred other things) including giving the person a QR code to
get their prize shipped, and then someone from the company can reach out if warranted.

This project actually illustrates how you have to think about GDPR ahead of everything
else when you glue lots of stuff together like this, and there are indeed challenges
with the Discord API at scale, but I believe it's a project that will work.

I have a repo for this I'll dust off next month, maybe.

### Client Side -> Edge Side Search

For really big sites, it would be interesting if the compiled client-side index used for
client-side search could be just moved to an edge function upon deployment. It's not a 
bad idea, though a little unconventional and prone to timing issues. 

Third-party search options are getting harder to get working (and more expensive) as the 
products evolve, so this might be a neat hybrid approach.

Anyway, that's my list for the year, mostly around static sites. But I've seen people doing
all kinds of interesting things from fully-blown functional CRON systems to raw data pipes
to worker farms to others - and there's plenty of freemium options, so it's a fun thing to 
play with.
