In\nfact it went so well that the process was as miraculous as it was unremarkable, in a\ngreat way. </p><p>I'll just get down to what you'll see that's different:</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"youll-still-show-up-in-the-live-user-view\">You'll Still Show Up In The Live User View<a href=\"#youll-still-show-up-in-the-live-user-view\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to You'll Still Show Up In The Live User View\" title=\"Direct link to You'll Still Show Up In The Live User View\">​</a></h3><p>Nothing, at least as far as I can figure out from lots of poking around, will\nprevent traffic that is flagged as internal from activating the \"live\" user over\nworld map infographic. </p><p>Howver, you <strong><em>should</em></strong> notice that you no longer affect the event count, which you\ncan generally confirm by setting the date range to \"Today\" and examine it as you\naccess the site, like below:</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/ga4-update-events.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"One of these things shouldn't update like the other\" alt=\"GA4 Live View\"><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"your-engagement-time-will-drop-likely-significantly\">Your Engagement Time Will Drop, Likely Significantly<a href=\"#your-engagement-time-will-drop-likely-significantly\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Your Engagement Time Will Drop, Likely Significantly\" title=\"Direct link to Your Engagement Time Will Drop, Likely Significantly\">​</a></h3><p>This behavior is somewhat compounded with sites that have a lot of history in GA4\nprior to filtering out internal use. Each pre-defined period (14 days, 28 days, etc)\nwill seem correct but they won't quite be in sync when comparing to the previous frame,\nso they'll be a bit bizarre for 10 - 15 days.</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/ga4-engagement-time.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"You spend too much time on that site anyway.\" alt=\"GA4 Real Time Engagement Stats Enlarged\"><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"youll-see-a-new-source\">You'll See A New Source<a href=\"#youll-see-a-new-source\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to You'll See A New Source\" title=\"Direct link to You'll See A New Source\">​</a></h3><p>Your use <em>is</em> still technically counted, and you can look at it just like organic social,\nsearch, or anything else:</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/ga4-update-unassigned.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"It's still technically assigned to unassigned, even if it says unassigned.\" alt=\"GA4 Traffic Sources Showing Unassigned Group\"><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"youll-wish-you-did-it-upon-setup\">You'll Wish You Did It Upon setup<a href=\"#youll-wish-you-did-it-upon-setup\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to You'll Wish You Did It Upon setup\" title=\"Direct link to You'll Wish You Did It Upon setup\">​</a></h3><p>It was somewhat weird watching it normalize and while any <em>custom</em> reports should be correct\nright away as they run through filters prior, it'll be disorienting to look at the generated\nreports that still reflect the internal use while comparing. </p><p>Hopefully you don't see what I mean (either because you did it early-on, or because Google made\nde-noising it atomic).</p><p>That's it for this series!

Put simply, how much time people stay\non various segments of your site could mean really good, or even potentially\nnot-so-good things, so you really want that number to be accurate.</p><p>Your team's early use of the site while setting up often pollutes\nthis engagement data at a really critical time; here's a tutorial on how to avoid\nthat!</p><a href=\"/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/internal-filtering-og.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Imagine 'complicated' and then take away reason and accountability\" alt=\"Creative depiction of a need to filter engagement data\"></a><p>To get the most out of this short tutorial, make sure you have the IP addresses that\nyour own use of your sites originates from handy, and about ten minutes of time. In fact,\nyou'll probably want to set up rules for additional remote workers or even other offices\nthat might interact with the sites like users would. </p><p>Depending on how you have Analytics configured (I suggest using Google Tag\nManager; this tutorial assumes you are too), you probably don't load Analytics\ncode while your site is running in development or staging mode. </p><p>This means you won't pollute your data by testing and doing development work, but\ntag manager <em>will</em> always hoist Analytics code when the site is in production mode,\ncausing anything you do to count like you were a user. This isn't ideal, to say the\nleast, and hard-coded IP filter hacks in your site's source code really smells. </p><p>Here's how to deal with it using GA alone, step by step:</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"step-1-define-an-internal-traffic_type-for-the-google-tag\">Step 1: Define An \"internal\" <code>traffic_type</code> For The Google Tag:<a href=\"#step-1-define-an-internal-traffic_type-for-the-google-tag\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to step-1-define-an-internal-traffic_type-for-the-google-tag\" title=\"Direct link to step-1-define-an-internal-traffic_type-for-the-google-tag\">​</a></h3><p>This, unfortunately, entails a lot of clicks. First, go to the Admin\nsection of analytics:</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-1.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Next, click on \"Data Streams\" and click on the site you want to modify\non the right:</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-2.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Then, scroll down to the \"Google Tag\" settings part of the site. Click on\nthat:</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-3.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Then click on \"Configure Tag Settings\":</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-4.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Once you've done that, click on \"Show All\" (I <em>told</em> you this was hidden):</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-5.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Next, click on \"Define Internal Traffic\":</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-6.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Finally! Create a new location, name it meainingfully, and provide IP addresses\nindividually, or with a netmask (like if you want a whole /24 ignored). <strong>Make\nabsolutely sure that you save it! Note the save button in the top-right:</strong></p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-7.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>PHEW.

Go back to the main admin route and this time, click on the\n\"Data Settings\" icon, expand the little menu, and then click on the \"Filters\" link. You\nwill see that Google so thoughtfully created the filter for you, even though they don't\nshow you this functionality when you set it up.</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-8.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><p>Click on the filter and enable it. Make sure you save! You can set it to testing if you\nwant, but that still makes reporting noisy unless you filter it out later, so I recommend\njust turning it off right away. </p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/screenshot-9.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Screenshot\" alt=\"Supplementary Screenshot\"><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"step-3-wait-a-few-hours-then-test\">Step 3: Wait A Few Hours, Then Test<a href=\"#step-3-wait-a-few-hours-then-test\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Step 3: Wait A Few Hours, Then Test\" title=\"Direct link to Step 3: Wait A Few Hours, Then Test\">​</a></h3><p>Google says it can take a while for changes to be applied to all recent data (which seems\nto be the case in my experience), but you will notice that it almost immediately stops all\nlogging from the addresses you provided. Confirm this by hitting production links from a\nlocation that you squelched.</p><p>Initially, even the \"live\" view stopped registering my visists from internally-flagged IPs,\nbut this flickered as changes were applied. I'll update this post in several weeks once enough\ntime has passed and note what the end behavior looks like, if it differs from what Google says\nto expect. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"closing\">Closing<a href=\"#closing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Closing\" title=\"Direct link to Closing\">​</a></h3><p>I think Google should simplify this process, including providing a better tool to\nlook up your own IP address. This is a great example use case for filters in general, and\nyou probably noticed there's a lot more that you can do with them. </p><p>This easy enough to add to your setup checklist, now that you know where it lives. I hope you\nfound this useful!</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"update-as-promised\">Update, As Promised!<a href=\"#update-as-promised\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Update, As Promised!\" title=\"Direct link to Update, As Promised!\">​</a></h3><p>I've <a href=\"/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/\">posted an update</a> about how it went and what I\nlearned to expect when I deploy more documentation domains. I'll definitely be doing this early\nin the process from now on, before it has a chance to get in the way.</p>",

Well, maybe there is one excuse: not knowing what to write about. I can help\nthere; let's talk about a bunch of stuff you can do when you really don't have great witty\nideas to send out.</p><p>How you structure your community digest is up to you. Once a community reaches more than 50\npeople, I like to have a <em>community specific</em> newsletter that I launch just for community-related\nupdates. It's a great way to focus engagement on things in an easy, relaxed way and a great way\nto keep community satisfaction high.</p><p>I try to keep community newsletters speific to <em>community</em> news, even though that's frequently going\nto overlap with some product news, I like to keep the product stuff to the primary newsletter that\nthe investors and everyone else gets. </p><p>Here's some ideas for what can go in your community newsletter perennially, or just as-needed when you\ndon't have enough other content to really justify sending something out:</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"spotlight-heroes--welcome-nominations\">Spotlight Heroes &amp; Welcome Nominations<a href=\"#spotlight-heroes--welcome-nominations\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Spotlight Heroes &amp; Welcome Nominations\" title=\"Direct link to Spotlight Heroes &amp; Welcome Nominations\">​</a></h3><p>Set a high threshold for this so it's a big deal when someone crosses it, but make sure you keep track\nof the effort people are putting in, and when they really crush something or go above and beyond, shine\na light on them by telling the story to everyone else.</p><p>Reach out to the person in advance because this kind of spotlight can be uncomfortable for<br>\n<!-- -->some, and make sure people know you are interested in hearing about other instances that should\nbe celebrated. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"leak-some-inside-info\">\"Leak\" Some Inside Info<a href=\"#leak-some-inside-info\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to &quot;Leak&quot; Some Inside Info\" title=\"Direct link to &quot;Leak&quot; Some Inside Info\">​</a></h3><p>Everyone loves an inside scoop. Could your product team occasionally provide some screen shots or\nother teasers so your community occasionally gets early access? It's a great way to get early feedback,\nmake people feel special, and make sure there's something interesting for them to read about. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"interview-a-developer-or-pm\">Interview A Developer Or PM<a href=\"#interview-a-developer-or-pm\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Interview A Developer Or PM\" title=\"Direct link to Interview A Developer Or PM\">​</a></h3><p>I once maintained a newsletter where in each issue, we would ask the community to send some questions for\none of our product managers as we published the answers to the questions posted the previous week. This was\na great two-way conduit for our product team with me as a sort of filter and go-between and was a favorite\npart of the newsletter.</p><p>You might find that, upon asking around, other employees might have great insights or topics to share with your\ncommunity as employees see that other interviews are received positively and appreciated. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"adopt-a-pr\">Adopt A PR<a href=\"#adopt-a-pr\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Adopt A PR\" title=\"Direct link to Adopt A PR\">​</a></h3><p>Some pull requests represent a great deal of work and care, but need someone else to care about them a little\nbefore they can be accepted. It's super helpful, extremely welcoming, and very empowering to the whole community.</p><p>It's helpful if you organize outreach to receive nominations for these, with self-nominations being explicitly\nencouraged. Similarly, offer to help maintainers of projects that your community cares about find new contributors,\nor even new maintainers entirely if necessary.</p><p>A little facilitating can get you a lot of goodwill. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"community-blog-posts--call-for-submissions\">Community Blog Posts &amp; Call For Submissions<a href=\"#community-blog-posts--call-for-submissions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Community Blog Posts &amp; Call For Submissions\" title=\"Direct link to Community Blog Posts &amp; Call For Submissions\">​</a></h3><p>It's great when people who don't work at your company write about your product. Make sure your community knows you'll\nsyndicate posts they write and tell you about in your main newsletter, even if they aren't 100% flattering. It's also\ngreat if you reach out to community authors when you have paid writing work available.</p><p>Never offer to pay people with exposure, but giving exposure when they've already done something awesome is\na great thing to do. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"hidden-prizes\">Hidden Prizes<a href=\"#hidden-prizes\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Hidden Prizes\" title=\"Direct link to Hidden Prizes\">​</a></h3><p>Once in a while, deliver some completely spontaneous and random fun. Give stickers for those that participate in a \"caption this\"\ncontest, or something else that just lets people be happy they opened your email. Make a meme or two. Feature your own poorly-drawn\ncomic strip, as long as it's relevant to the community. </p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"let-it-become-community-led\">Let It Become Community-led<a href=\"#let-it-become-community-led\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Let It Become Community-led\" title=\"Direct link to Let It Become Community-led\">​</a></h3><p>These are just ideas. The best newsletter is the one you produce based on feedback from your community. What matters is\nthat you send it, send it consistently, and make sure you put some real attention toward making each issue valuable.</p>",

I once had a coworker\nwho said the best color for the bike shed is <em>fire</em>. I agree, <em>usually</em>, but they can be useful\nthings in community dynamics. </p><p>There are two things that I really want you to know when it comes to initially fostering a new community:</p><ol><li>The organism, especially an online organism, <a href=\"https://www.azquotes.com/quote/968276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will do whatever it damn well pleases</a>. I'm not kidding.</li><li>Your choice of what software to use should be ultimately decided by users, after being initially\ndriven by user journey stories.</li></ol><p>If you understand both of those things, you might also say that this\nseems a <em>little</em> over-simplified to you, and you're not wrong, but I'll do\nmy best to explain it in less than five minutes:</p><a href=\"/blog/community-software/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/blog/community-software/community-growth-og.png\" class=\"blogImage img_ev3q\" title=\"Communities Like Making Their Own Decisions\" alt=\"Artwork representing a community\"></a><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"drive-and-protect-growth-dont-try-to-control-it-too-much\">Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much<a href=\"#drive-and-protect-growth-dont-try-to-control-it-too-much\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much\" title=\"Direct link to Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much\">​</a></h3><p>Wild idea: Let your community decide on the software it wants so that you're free to build\nthings that will delight them. Isn't that reflective of why you wanted a community in the\nfirst place?</p><p>What if it was <em>just</em> your job to evaluate what's out there so you can rule any clear deal-breakers\nout in conversations, and up to your community to decide on what it wants? For instance, let users\nknow that you require any vendor to be SOC-2 certified with all of the proper GDPR tooling. </p><p>I know what you're going to say: you'll need some kind of platform in order to even get that much\ngoing, but that means we're now thinking on the same page! Use whatever works for <em>you</em> in the\nvery early instance, because it's critical that <em>you</em> have a constant presence in the community\nearly-on:</p><ul><li><p>You need to <strong>be there full time initially</strong> to deal with naysayers, spam, and have a voice with a\nvision. You're the butler, the host, and the entertainment. </p></li><li><p>You then need to <strong>guard for question repitition</strong>. The minute you see it, launch a discussion\nabout where Q&amp;A should happen so that people don't get exhausted answering the same\nquestions over and over again. </p></li></ul><p>I've watched developer communities die slow agonzing deaths in Slack channels because founders\nstopped at this very first step, and checked out until they could hire someone to do that. </p><p><strong><em>In my experience, \"false starts\" can be extremely toxic to future attempts fostering a community.</em></strong> Don't\nbegin this process until you're ready to have it on your plate and eat it, too. </p><p>Then, just like in a garden, you let the plants run the show while you establish new boundaries\nand help move things around as needed to suppor their growth. That's the farthest I take the metaphor,\nthough; when you're talking details about nurturing communities you need real KPIs, not metaphors.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"your-initial-choice-should-be-very-driven-by-user-journey-stories\">Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories<a href=\"#your-initial-choice-should-be-very-driven-by-user-journey-stories\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\" title=\"Direct link to Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\">​</a></h3><p>If you don't know what a user journey story is, you might be a little ahead of things by looking at\na community right now. A user journey story is a narrative that you create which, to the\nbest of your ability, reflects every detail of how people will find the thing you're building,\nand why they'll want to use it. </p><p>Here's a fictitious ancient user story someone could have written about <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Subversion</a>,\nfor example, back when it was rapidly-overtaking <a href=\"https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CVS</a> as the version control system of\nchoice before Git:</p><blockquote><p><em>April is a senior developer at FuzzyWuzzy, and was tired of always e-mailing their\ncode updates in <code>.tgz</code> format even though the company used CVS, because it was so\ndifficult to use. They searched around and found Subversion was easier to use and\noffered support beyond mailing lists.</em> </p></blockquote><p>So in this ancient example, we might, say, launch an IRC channel where we invite some\npeople to see if we can make some community magic happen, and use that channel to\ncoordinate launching something more useful and appropriate based on actual needs that\npeople communicate, not guesswork.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"but-tim-isnt-there-some-software-you-love-above-all-others\">But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?<a href=\"#but-tim-isnt-there-some-software-you-love-above-all-others\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\" title=\"Direct link to But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\">​</a></h3><p>I have favorite wrenches, too, but I don't use them when I should be holding a lufa sponge,\nyou know?</p><p>Yes, you need to treat your community as something that has the same observability as any other\nimportant thing - and there are thankfully great choices for that. There's also great community\nplatforms popping up all the time. </p><p>Your community will develop features of its own through process if you don't implement it\nin software, so you might as well give them the largest seat at the table of what's being\nused.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"summing-it-up\">Summing It Up:<a href=\"#summing-it-up\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Summing It Up:\" title=\"Direct link to Summing It Up:\">​</a></h3><p>Don't get hung up on software if you want to start fostering a community around your\nproduct. Instead, get busy working out all the ways you expect people to find your\nproduct, determine some low-friction routes for folks using it to find eachother,\nand be there to help them grow when <em>they're</em> ready. Just make sure they know the\ncriteria for an acceptable platform. </p><p>By doing it this way, you collaborate out of the gate and instill more trust, and the\noptimal setup tends to find itself. Just make sure you're there to follow through,\nbe the face and voice, and executue on what they decide along with you.</p><p>Maybe four minutes. Okay it was probably five.

I might even package\na few I'm building around my own site, if I can think of a sensible way to \"package\"\nthe serverless part of it. </p><p>So without further rambling, here's my list in no real order other than recall:</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"was-this-document-helpful-plugin-for-docusaurus\">\"Was this document helpful?\" plugin for Docusaurus<a href=\"#was-this-document-helpful-plugin-for-docusaurus\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to &quot;Was this document helpful?&quot; plugin for Docusaurus\" title=\"Direct link to &quot;Was this document helpful?&quot; plugin for Docusaurus\">​</a></h3><p>I have no desire to implement comments or anything else that would require moderation,\nbut getting feedback about the relevancy and usefulness of all of your docs and\nblog posts would be pretty super duper, right? </p><p>Edge functions are great at handling all of the rate limiting and other stuff you'd\nwant to implement server-side, as well as an API to get stats from it. Many of them\noffer some kind of storage option on the same physical network to store responses.</p><p>The caveat here is, you may or may not be able to access local storage and dependency\nresolution / loading could be an obstacle. Anyway, I'm kicking around the idea of\nbuilding it if I can do it in a portable way manageably.</p><p>I could probably get a V0 option for that done very quickly on Deno, but that kinda\nmarries using the plugin to using Deno Deploy or someone that resold it. Not ideal.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"my-devrel-discord-bot-box-awaitbot\">My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)<a href=\"#my-devrel-discord-bot-box-awaitbot\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\" title=\"Direct link to My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\">​</a></h3><p>It's easy to run user engagement events in Discord when you have droids helping you\nmanage it. Over the years, I've found that self-service contests work extremely well\nfor some of the same scenarios you might think about organizing a hackathon to boost.</p><p>The idea is, you let the user set their own definition of \"done\" for a project by\nallowing the user to tell a bot that they're working on something, and then letting\nthe bot know when the project was done by including a link or a screen shot. </p><p>The bot can then (do a hundred other things) including giving the person a QR code to\nget their prize shipped, and then someone from the company can reach out if warranted.</p><p>This project actually illustrates how you have to think about GDPR ahead of everything\nelse when you glue lots of stuff together like this, and there are indeed challenges\nwith the Discord API at scale, but I believe it's a project that will work.</p><p>I have a repo for this I'll dust off next month, maybe.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"client-side---edge-side-search\">Client Side -&gt; Edge Side Search<a href=\"#client-side---edge-side-search\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Client Side -> Edge Side Search\" title=\"Direct link to Client Side -> Edge Side Search\">​</a></h3><p>For really big sites, it would be interesting if the compiled client-side index used for\nclient-side search could be just moved to an edge function upon deployment. It's not a\nbad idea, though a little unconventional and prone to timing issues. </p><p>Third-party search options are getting harder to get working (and more expensive) as the\nproducts evolve, so this might be a neat hybrid approach. </p><hr><p>Anyway, that's my list for the year, mostly around static sites. But I've seen people doing\nall kinds of interesting things from fully-blown functional CRON systems to raw data pipes\nto worker farms to others - and there's plenty of freemium options, so it's a fun thing to\nplay with.</p>",
