Long-term\nsurvival is never a sure thing for anyone, but cancer survivors feel a lot\nbetter every year after their fifth year of remission because even older\nsurvival numbers go up and to the right afterward.</p><p>Being asked something like ...  <em>where do you see yourself in a few years?</em> in\nan interview no longer summons existential angst, which is a huge deal for me.\nI can rationally see myself building something long-term, not just contributing\nwhere I can to short-term needs while I waited to see how things went. </p><p>I've filled in my time by doing some contract work to meet our minimum expenses,\nwhich has led me to amazing experiences I couldn't possibly have had otherwise.\nHowever, I want to contribute more than just content assignments; I'm not done\nmaking my mark on DevRel. </p><p>I've been in language-agnostic roles for years; I helped to implement Stack Overflow's\nnow famous remote-first work culture for the community growth team, I have\noodles of management experience and I'm a pretty darn nice guy. I've also got\na <a href=\"/stack\">pretty capable studio</a>. </p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"so-what-do-i-want-to-do\">So, What do I want to do?<a href=\"#so-what-do-i-want-to-do\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to So, What do I want to do?\" title=\"Direct link to So, What do I want to do?\">​</a></h2><p>I want to help mentor the next age of DevRel pros. I want to bring everything I have\nlearned from running the world's hugest developer community together with my love for\nhelping people find their own voice and confidence on their feet. I want to direct\ncontent, sure, but I want to teach others <em>how</em> that process works. </p><p>I also sorely miss the art of community building and management. And, well, I miss\nlonger-term relationships in general, which feels a bit lacking when you're just\nan outside contractor.  </p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-do-i-want-out-of-it\">What do I want out of it?<a href=\"#what-do-i-want-out-of-it\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What do I want out of it?\" title=\"Direct link to What do I want out of it?\">​</a></h2><p>What I need from an employer:</p><ul><li>Remote-first culture</li><li>Flexible time. For tons of reasons.</li><li>Insurance that isn't a pain in the ass.</li><li>Rapid / fast-pace is great, if we keep it to 50-ish hour weeks.</li><li>Some kind of PTO program.</li><li>Commitment to a long-term DevRel program. I can be a one-person band,\nbut my goal is to build and lead a team with actually different people.</li></ul><p>As long as I can take breaks during the day and limit travel to a few times during\nthe year, my disability needs are met.  </p><p>Do you know someone? Please send them to me, or me to them!</p>",

I thought about it quite a\nbit when it was touch-and-go if Twitter would stabilize again, and in all\nfairness, that's still mostly the case.</p><p>I also realized that I was leaking my own narrative, abut two hundred characters\nat a time. Instead of writing the stories of my experiences coherently, with my\nown purpose and vision, I was just adding short quips to the collective\nnarrative. There's nothing wrong with adding to the collective, provided that\nyou're writing your own version, too.</p><p>So, I had to do the thing I said I wasn't going to do again: I had to build yet\nanother personal website. I didn't feel like getting a degree in hot new\nframeworks, so I was originally going to go with Astro but Tailwind is just not\ncomfortable for me for a personal project, so I ended up using:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Docusaurus Plushie\" src=\"/assets/images/docusaurus-plushie-banner-a60f7593abca1e3eef26a9afa244e4fb.jpeg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>... at least for now. I really want to play with Astro, as well as Fresh, but\nthe ecosystems around both are pretty Tailwind-heavy for the time being.</p><p>And for just a blog with a few static pages - Docusaurus is fine. I may even\nbring back the docs and create some tutorials eventually, but the goal right now\nis to just have a better professional presence.</p>",
