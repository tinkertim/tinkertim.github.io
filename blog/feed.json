I once had a coworker\nwho said the best color for the bike shed is <em>fire</em>. I agree, <em>usually</em>, but they can be useful\nthings in community dynamics. </p><p>There are two things that I really want you to know when it comes to initially fostering a new community:</p><ol><li>The organism, especially an online organism, <a href=\"https://www.azquotes.com/quote/968276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will do whatever it damn well pleases</a>. I'm not kidding.</li><li>Your choice of what software to use should be ultimately decided by users, after being initially\ndriven by user journey stories.</li></ol><p>If you understand both of those things, you might also say that this\nseems a <em>little</em> over-simplified to you, and you're not wrong, but I'll do\nmy best to explain it in less than five minutes:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Community Growth\" src=\"/assets/images/community-growth-og-dbbb34fbfdd675958563158124ceda57.png\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"drive-and-protect-growth-dont-try-to-control-it-too-much\">Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much<a href=\"#drive-and-protect-growth-dont-try-to-control-it-too-much\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much\" title=\"Direct link to Drive And Protect Growth; Don't Try To Control It Too Much\">​</a></h3><p>Wild idea: Let your community decide on the software it wants so that you're free to build\nthings that will delight them. Isn't that reflective of why you wanted a community in the\nfirst place?</p><p>What if it was <em>just</em> your job to evaluate what's out there so you can rule any clear deal-breakers\nout in conversations, and up to your community to decide on what it wants? For instance, let users\nknow that you require any vendor to be SOC-2 certified with all of the proper GDPR tooling. </p><p>I know what you're going to say: you'll need some kind of platform in order to even get that much\ngoing, but that means we're now thinking on the same page! Use whatever works for <em>you</em> in the\nvery early instance, because it's critical that <em>you</em> have a constant presence in the community\nearly-on:</p><ul><li><p>You need to <strong>be there full time initially</strong> to deal with naysayers, spam, and have a voice with a\nvision. You're the butler, the host, and the entertainment. </p></li><li><p>You then need to <strong>guard for question repitition</strong>. The minute you see it, launch a discussion\nabout where Q&amp;A should happen so that people don't get exhausted answering the same\nquestions over and over again. </p></li></ul><p>I've watched developer communities die slow agonzing deaths in Slack channels because founders\nstopped at this very first step, and checked out until they could hire someone to do that. </p><p><strong><em>In my experience, \"false starts\" can be extremely toxic to future attempts fostering a community.</em></strong> Don't\nbegin this process until you're ready to have it on your plate and eat it, too. </p><p>Then, just like in a garden, you let the plants run the show while you establish new boundaries\nand help move things around as needed to suppor their growth. That's the farthest I take the metaphor,\nthough; when you're talking details about nurturing communities you need real KPIs, not metaphors.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"your-initial-choice-should-be-very-driven-by-user-journey-stories\">Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories<a href=\"#your-initial-choice-should-be-very-driven-by-user-journey-stories\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\" title=\"Direct link to Your Initial Choice Should Be Very Driven By User Journey Stories\">​</a></h3><p>If you don't know what a user journey story is, you might be a little ahead of things by looking at\na community right now. A user journey story is a narrative that you create which, to the\nbest of your ability, reflects every detail of how people will find the thing you're building,\nand why they'll want to use it. </p><p>Here's a fictitious ancient user story someone could have written about <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Subversion</a>,\nfor example, back when it was rapidly-overtaking <a href=\"https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CVS</a> as the version control system of\nchoice before Git:</p><blockquote><p><em>April is a senior developer at FuzzyWuzzy, and was tired of always e-mailing their\ncode updates in <code>.tgz</code> format even though the company used CVS, because it was so\ndifficult to use. They searched around and found Subversion was easier to use and\noffered support beyond mailing lists.</em> </p></blockquote><p>So in this ancient example, we might, say, launch an IRC channel where we invite some\npeople to see if we can make some community magic happen, and use that channel to\ncoordinate launching something more useful and appropriate based on actual needs that\npeople communicate, not guesswork.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"but-tim-isnt-there-some-software-you-love-above-all-others\">But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?<a href=\"#but-tim-isnt-there-some-software-you-love-above-all-others\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\" title=\"Direct link to But, Tim, Isn't There Some Software You Love Above All Others?\">​</a></h3><p>I have favorite wrenches, too, but I don't use them when I should be holding a lufa sponge,\nyou know?</p><p>Yes, you need to treat your community as something that has the same observability as any other\nimportant thing - and there are thankfully great choices for that. There's also great community\nplatforms popping up all the time. </p><p>Your community will develop features of its own through process if you don't implement it\nin software, so you might as well give them the largest seat at the table of what's being\nused.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"summing-it-up\">Summing It Up:<a href=\"#summing-it-up\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Summing It Up:\" title=\"Direct link to Summing It Up:\">​</a></h3><p>Don't get hung up on software if you want to start fostering a community around your\nproduct. Instead, get busy working out all the ways you expect people to find your\nproduct, determine some low-friction routes for folks using it to find eachother,\nand be there to help them grow when <em>they're</em> ready. Just make sure they know the\ncriteria for an acceptable platform. </p><p>By doing it this way, you collaborate out of the gate and instill more trust, and the\noptimal setup tends to find itself. Just make sure you're there to follow through,\nbe the face and voice, and executue on what they decide along with you.</p><p>Maybe four minutes. Okay it was probably five. But I hope you enjoyed reading!</p>",

These well-orchestrated SPAs are great, in fact this blg post is being\nbrought to you with one of them, but they're just that - static.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Functions\" src=\"/assets/images/functions-og-00c9a935df1380693b6fe8e74d0e20b3.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>I used the Google link because the vendors are still figuring it out. This is all\nstill kinda new, which is neat (IMHO).</p><p>There are enough places that provide usable \"freemium tier\" edge functions, some\neven complete with storage, that hobbyists and open-source enthisiasts like me\ncan build stuff and not need to pay a monthly bill for it. I might even package\na few I'm building around my own site, if I can think of a sensible way to \"package\"\nthe serverless part of it. </p><p>So without further rambling, here's my list in no real order other than recall:</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"was-this-document-helpful-plugin-for-docusaurus\">\"Was this document helpful?\" plugin for Docusaurus<a href=\"#was-this-document-helpful-plugin-for-docusaurus\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to &quot;Was this document helpful?&quot; plugin for Docusaurus\" title=\"Direct link to &quot;Was this document helpful?&quot; plugin for Docusaurus\">​</a></h3><p>I have no desire to implement comments or anything else that would require moderation,\nbut getting feedback about the relevancy and usefulness of all of your docs and\nblog posts would be pretty super duper, right? </p><p>Edge functions are great at handling all of the rate limiting and other stuff you'd\nwant to implement server-side, as well as an API to get stats from it. Many of them\noffer some kind of storage option on the same physical network to store responses.</p><p>The caveat here is, you may or may not be able to access local storage and dependency\nresolution / loading could be an obstacle. Anyway, I'm kicking around the idea of\nbuilding it if I can do it in a portable way manageably.</p><p>I could probably get a V0 option for that done very quickly on Deno, but that kinda\nmarries using the plugin to using Deno Deploy or someone that resold it. Not ideal.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"my-devrel-discord-bot-box-awaitbot\">My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)<a href=\"#my-devrel-discord-bot-box-awaitbot\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\" title=\"Direct link to My DevRel Discord Bot Box (Awaitbot)\">​</a></h3><p>It's easy to run user engagement events in Discord when you have droids helping you\nmanage it. Over the years, I've found that self-service contests work extremely well\nfor some of the same scenarios you might think about organizing a hackathon to boost.</p><p>The idea is, you let the user set their own definition of \"done\" for a project by\nallowing the user to tell a bot that they're working on something, and then letting\nthe bot know when the project was done by including a link or a screen shot. </p><p>The bot can then (do a hundred other things) including giving the person a QR code to\nget their prize shipped, and then someone from the company can reach out if warranted.</p><p>This project actually illustrates how you have to think about GDPR ahead of everything\nelse when you glue lots of stuff together like this, and there are indeed challenges\nwith the Discord API at scale, but I believe it's a project that will work.</p><p>I have a repo for this I'll dust off next month, maybe.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"client-side---edge-side-search\">Client Side -&gt; Edge Side Search<a href=\"#client-side---edge-side-search\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Client Side -> Edge Side Search\" title=\"Direct link to Client Side -> Edge Side Search\">​</a></h3><p>For really big sites, it would be interesting if the compiled client-side index used for\nclient-side search could be just moved to an edge function upon deployment. It's not a\nbad idea, though a little unconventional and prone to timing issues. </p><p>Third-party search options are getting harder to get working (and more expensive) as the\nproducts evolve, so this might be a neat hybrid approach. </p><hr><p>Anyway, that's my list for the year, mostly around static sites. But I've seen people doing\nall kinds of interesting things from fully-blown functional CRON systems to raw data pipes\nto worker farms to others - and there's plenty of freemium options, so it's a fun thing to\nplay with.</p>",
