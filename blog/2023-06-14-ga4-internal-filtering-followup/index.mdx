title: "Internal Filtering With GA4: After Everything Settled"
description: It was hard to tell at first what effect, if any, filtering out internal use had on the data I already collected. Turned out it was major, so I'm summarizing what to expect.

In [my last GA4 tutorial](/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/), we went over the 
somewhat inordinate number of steps that you need to take in order to
make sure that your own use of your sites isn't silently skewing your Google 
Analytics engagement metrics behind the scenes.

In this post, I'll go over what you can expect when you apply the filters and 
how you can be relatively certain that your data is now de-noised.

<p class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--md"><a id="more">&nbsp;</a>--</p>

As far as I can tell, the de-noising process ran effectively and all historical 
internal use of the site was regrouped into a group that is excluded by default. In 
fact it went so well that the process was as miraculous as it was unremarkable, in a 
great way. 

I'll just get down to what you'll see that's different:

### You'll Still Show Up In The Live User View

Nothing, at least as far as I can figure out from lots of poking around, will 
prevent traffic that is flagged as internal from activating the "live" user over 
world map infographic. 

Howver, you ***should*** notice that you no longer affect the event count, which you 
can generally confirm by setting the date range to "Today" and examine it as you 
access the site, like below:

    className="blogImage" 
    title="One of these things shouldn't update like the other"
    alt="GA4 Live View"    
/>

### Your Engagement Time Will Drop, Likely Significantly

This behavior is somewhat compounded with sites that have a lot of history in GA4 
prior to filtering out internal use. Each pre-defined period (14 days, 28 days, etc)
will seem correct but they won't quite be in sync when comparing to the previous frame, 
so they'll be a bit bizarre for 10 - 15 days.

### You'll See A New Source 

Your use _is_ still technically counted, and you can look at it just like organic social, 
search, or anything else:

<img 
    src="/img/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/ga4-update-unassigned.png" 
    className="blogImage" 
    title="It's still technically assigned to unassigned, even if it says unassigned."
    alt="GA4 Traffic Sources Showing Unassigned Group"    
/>


### You'll Wish You Did It Upon setup

It was somewhat weird watching it normalize and while any _custom_ reports should be correct
right away as they run through filters prior, it'll be disorienting to look at the generated 
reports that still reflect the internal use while comparing. 

Hopefully you don't see what I mean (either because you did it early-on, or because Google made
de-noising it atomic).


That's it for this series! I hope you found it helpful!
