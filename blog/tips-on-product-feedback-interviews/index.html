In fact, there&#x27;s
an art to running them that isn&#x27;t obvious to the inexperienced, which I quickly discovered
when I first sat down with someone to talk about their experience on a new site called
Stack Overflow years ago.  </p><p>This post contains most of what I wished I knew back then, condensed into a ten minute
read.</p><a href="/blog/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/#more"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/blog/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews-og.png" class="blogImage img_ev3q" title="How we imagine user interviews when we plan them. Reality remains unaccountable to our expectations." alt="Creative depiction of people having coffee and talking"></a><p>If you&#x27;re just skimming, there&#x27;s one thing I <strong><em>really hope</em></strong> you&#x27;ll take away today:
<strong>product interviews are harder than they seem on the surface to pull off well</strong>. If the person
doing the interview hasn&#x27;t done an enormous amount of prep first, including sitting in on other
people doing interviews, they can go from fun to awful really quickly. </p><p class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--md"><a id="more"> </a>--</p><p>I&#x27;m assuming that you have some kind of community or developer portal that shows people where to
go depending on what they need, and that you have some kind of analytics running there that shows
you where you have pockets of users geographically. This leads us to ...</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="location-location-location">Location, Location, Location!<a href="#location-location-location" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Location, Location, Location!" title="Direct link to Location, Location, Location!">​</a></h3><p>You&#x27;ll need to know where you should locate yourself in order to maximize being convenient to
users in-person, or know which time zones you&#x27;ll have to optimize for in order to conduct these
virtually. Either way, you need this data.</p><p>If you are friends with a company that markets to the same kinds of developers that you need to
reach, you could ask them for some advice if you don&#x27;t have enough meaningful data yourself. But
I have to warn you: if you&#x27;re so young that you still don&#x27;t have this, you might not be ready for
these interviews yet. Keep reading nonetheless, but that could be your gut trying to tell you
something. </p><p>Don&#x27;t expect people to come to you, even if you sweeten the deal with gift cards. Inertia costs
way more than $50 for many developers to overcome. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understand-each-users-conversational-needs">Understand Each User&#x27;s Conversational Needs<a href="#understand-each-users-conversational-needs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understand Each User&#x27;s Conversational Needs" title="Direct link to Understand Each User&#x27;s Conversational Needs">​</a></h3><p>I&#x27;m assuming you have a privacy policy and an event code of conduct. Don&#x27;t proceed if either are
lacking, it would be a major trust and safety issue. </p><p>Here are some things that are helpful to collect in advance from people who volunteer to be
interviewed:</p><ul><li>Person&#x27;s background with the product and how they use it (work, hobby, etc)</li><li>If any accommodations need to be met, including any accessibility concerns. </li><li>Any social media links that they&#x27;d like shared with you and the product team</li><li>A free-form &quot;anything else&quot; box.</li></ul><p>Make sure this info is collected in a way that works with your company&#x27;s privacy policy and
data retention policies.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understand-each-users-stake--goals">Understand Each User&#x27;s Stake &amp; Goals<a href="#understand-each-users-stake--goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understand Each User&#x27;s Stake &amp; Goals" title="Direct link to Understand Each User&#x27;s Stake &amp; Goals">​</a></h3><p>You will be meeting with a human who may or may not:</p><ul><li>Feel a little star struck</li><li>Be in a <em>massive</em> hurry to tell you about one or two particular things before they forget</li><li>Be extroverted</li><li>Be on-time</li><li>Be nervous</li><li>Be typical in any way at all </li></ul><p>The best thing you can do is open with <em>&quot;Hi I&#x27;m <!-- -->[you]<!-- --> and I&#x27;m the <!-- -->[title]<!-- --> at <!-- -->[company]<!-- -->. Everyone calls
me <!-- -->[name]<!-- --> and refers to me as he or him. Your timing is absolutely perfect! Before we get started, is
there anything you want to make sure we have time to talk about, or anything you need to talk about
before we begin the interview?&quot;</em></p><p>You know <em>your</em> goals for this interview. To make the experience as fruitful for the user as possible,
use your interviewing super powers to make sure they know <em>their</em> goals, too!</p><p>This should put everyone at a bit more ease because you can focus on the conversation now that the
outcome goals have been charted. This also keeps the smalltalk positive, because nobody is apologizing
for running late or feeling like they look a mess. </p><p>Let them know that there will be time to ask questions at the end. Remember that recording requires
consent, and you should get a signed release even if you record the consent (DocuSign FTW)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="practicing-your-presence-is-key">Practicing Your Presence Is Key<a href="#practicing-your-presence-is-key" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Practicing Your Presence Is Key" title="Direct link to Practicing Your Presence Is Key">​</a></h3><p>You can&#x27;t throw an interview together on a flight. If you don&#x27;t try this and practice
it with a few people that actually know how the thing is supposed to work, things might
not go very well. </p><p>I am the last person to underestimate someone&#x27;s ability to accomplish magnificent things
at the very last minute - that&#x27;s how I sometimes work too! And as someone that thrives when
the dopamine can actually keep up, I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s going to take longer than you think.</p><p>A user interview is almost like a demo that you have to make a trainee do for you, with the
patience of a saint. As long as you know what you&#x27;re up against, you do you. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="optimize-for-the-users-time-in-general-and-for-speaking">Optimize For The User&#x27;s Time (In General, And For Speaking)<a href="#optimize-for-the-users-time-in-general-and-for-speaking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Optimize For The User&#x27;s Time (In General, And For Speaking)" title="Direct link to Optimize For The User&#x27;s Time (In General, And For Speaking)">​</a></h3><p>Normally, in an interview, you want the person being <em>interviewed</em> to be the primary
speaker in a transcript, with the interviewer confined to short, broadly-comprehensible questions.</p><p>This means 85% of the talking should be the user, 10% the interviewer, and 5% the muffled junk
and long silences that you edit out.</p><p>You&#x27;ll find this a balancing act between injecting just enough anecdotes to keep the conversation
flowing, but make sure it&#x27;s to get <em>their</em> story re-started, not to tell yours to completion.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reiterate-the-users-key-points-frequently">Reiterate The User&#x27;s Key Points Frequently<a href="#reiterate-the-users-key-points-frequently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reiterate The User&#x27;s Key Points Frequently" title="Direct link to Reiterate The User&#x27;s Key Points Frequently">​</a></h3><p>Three French hens, two turtle doves and repetition does wonder for the brain! Not only does the
user hear you continually reiterate things that they agree with <em>because they said them</em>, it helps
them (and you) make sure trains of thoughts pas smoothly straight to the kaboose. </p><p>Imagine each main point that the user makes as a separate plate. Each detail about that is a serving
of something on that plate. Good waiters do this in their heads, you can learn how too, but that takes
a lot of time.</p><p>There are tips at the end of the post on how to manage this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understand-the-halo-effect">Understand The Halo Effect<a href="#understand-the-halo-effect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understand The Halo Effect" title="Direct link to Understand The Halo Effect">​</a></h3><p><strong><em>Don&#x27;t Be Right, Be A Successful Interviewer!</em></strong></p><p>There&#x27;s a strong bias in engineering culture that makes some of us -- okay, <em>most</em> of us --
feel as if we&#x27;re already qualified to be a junior engineer in every other field of engineering
once we&#x27;ve come really far in another.</p><p>There&#x27;s <em>just enough</em> merit to that silly notion that it causes us to think we&#x27;ve completely
figured out how everything else in the world <em>surely</em> works, and causes us to offer advice, often
unsolicited, on how to improve things.</p><p>So when users in interviews tell you stuff like <em>&quot;and by the way, if you just frob the pulse normalizers,
you&#x27;ll be able to scale much better!&quot;</em> just smile and write it down, even if you don&#x27;t use whatever
it is that they think you can improve. </p><p>The point is, it&#x27;s about harvesting, not planting. Of course you should correct major misinformation or
rumor or other things, but save the good fights for the product team themselves.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="practice-belaying-bewilderment-yes-you-read-that-correctly">Practice Belaying Bewilderment (Yes, You Read That Correctly)<a href="#practice-belaying-bewilderment-yes-you-read-that-correctly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Practice Belaying Bewilderment (Yes, You Read That Correctly)" title="Direct link to Practice Belaying Bewilderment (Yes, You Read That Correctly)">​</a></h3><p>I once observed a designer that had a unique disposition in regards to their shift keys: they only
ever touched them when caps lock wouldn&#x27;t accomplish the goal. </p><p>This means:</p><blockquote><p>Hello, World!</p></blockquote><p>Was typed as:</p><blockquote><p><code>&lt;caps lock&gt;H&lt;/caps lock&gt;+e+l+l+o+,+ &lt;caps lock&gt;W&lt;/caps lock&gt;+o+r+l+d+&lt;shift&gt;1&lt;/shift&gt;</code></p></blockquote><p>And for the next 75 minutes, <strong><em>they were going to be hand-coding HTML, JS and CSS right in front
of me</em></strong>. </p><p>My reaction was visceral, to say the least, but my curiosity kicked in quickly. It turned out
to be really cool that I could watch this very unique work flow, and I just observed. I knew
I&#x27;d need a day or two to process what I&#x27;d actually learned from watching them, and that was fine.</p><p>But there are more things where you have to have a reflex to suppress reactions that, unless managed,
tend to be expressed quite viscerally, without adequate filtering. Hold yourself to where you needed
others to be when you were the one that was different.</p><p>It takes practice. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consider-these-helpful-accessories--supplies">Consider These Helpful Accessories &amp; Supplies:<a href="#consider-these-helpful-accessories--supplies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consider These Helpful Accessories &amp; Supplies:" title="Direct link to Consider These Helpful Accessories &amp; Supplies:">​</a></h3><p>This is my standard gear for doing in-person interviews, the only difference in doing them remotely
is that recording is usually more convenient, and you&#x27;re likely using some kind of shared document
and doodle space instead of an actual table between you. </p><p>The last one is optional, of course, and more of an incentive to get people to interrupt their day
to talk to you.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vox-recorders">Vox Recorders<a href="#vox-recorders" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vox Recorders" title="Direct link to Vox Recorders">​</a></h4><p>I carry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083P5C2Q4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this small digital recorder</a> for every day
note taking, which is also an ideal recorder for in-person interviews. It has two features that
make it especially well-suited to the task:</p><ol><li><p>Instant-record functionality from the off position. I flip a switch upwards and in 15 seconds
I&#x27;m confident that a recording is going. </p></li><li><p>It accepts a standard 3/8&quot; TRS cable as input, which allows for mobile recording with quality
mics anywhere, using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QRZ77QN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small black box like this one</a></p></li><li><p>Easy-peasey USB-C fetching of mp3 output which you can set up to dump to your transcription

fungible medium. Rather than gesture in the air, I capture individual ideas that I want to explore
in sticky notes, and keep re-ordering and updating them as the conversation flows. </p><p>I like using colored Red, Yellow and Green notes specifically to capture problematic, neutral or
commendable experiences, as the user related them. This idea branches from something called a
friction log, which a former PM colleague named Megan Risdal introduced me to.</p><p>I&#x27;ve used her very elegant and simple system ever since.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="document-friction-logs">Document Friction Logs<a href="#document-friction-logs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Document Friction Logs" title="Direct link to Document Friction Logs">​</a></h4><p>Much like the sticky notes above, you can use red, green and yellow coloring in shared documents.</p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/blog/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/friction-log.png" class="blogImage img_ev3q" title="The simplest thing ever!" alt="Screen Shot Of A Google Doc"><p>I like to type notes as the user is talking (being careful to remain attentive to what they&#x27;re
saying) and highlight / change text color as an activity with the user. I can always fill out the
text more from the recording, what&#x27;s important is capturing high-level things and getting the color
coding correct while the user is with you. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="beep-not-a-robot">Beep! Not A Robot<a href="#beep-not-a-robot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Beep! Not A Robot" title="Direct link to Beep! Not A Robot">​</a></h4><p>Never underestimate the nerd factor in motivation. At Stack Overflow, we implemented a special badge
that could only be earned by attending an event and scanning a QR code that was linked to the event.</p><p>It was called &quot;Not A Robot&quot; as a play on the captcha phrasing. </p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/blog/tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/not-a-robot.png" class="blogImage img_ev3q" title="Beep Boo Beep!" alt="Screen Shot Of Not A Robot Badge"><p>There were guard rails in place to make sure the badge didn&#x27;t become too easy to get just by knowing
some employees, and it proved to be a significant motivator for people who were considering attending
one of our live events. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concluding">Concluding<a href="#concluding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concluding" title="Direct link to Concluding">​</a></h3><p>I hope you found some value in what I&#x27;ve shared here, and I hope you also feel more excited and
inspired when it comes to forming close connections with people that use what you create and promote. </p><p>Adding truly effective user sessions to your product feedback loops will more than pay for the
amount of prep that they require, and I think you&#x27;ll find, really deserve. If you feel like you&#x27;re
burning out a bit, why not go hit a city where lots of users are and spend time with humans that
really care about your work? </p><p>It would be very hard to have an uninspiring experience, especially if you&#x27;re prepared.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_Wr5y"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/product-led-growth/">product-led-growth</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/feedback-loops/">feedback-loops</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/user-interviews/">user-interviews</a></li></ul></div><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/tinkertim/tinkertim.github.io/tree/main/blog/2023-06-14-tips-on-product-feedback-interviews/index.mdx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/ga4-internal-filtering-followup/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Internal Filtering With GA4: After Everything Settled</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/ga4-internal-filtering/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">How To Stop Polluting Your GA4 Engagement Data &quot;Almost&quot;
