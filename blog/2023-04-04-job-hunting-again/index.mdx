## First, some good news!

I'm really thrilled that, after passing some relatively huge health 
milestones, it's now rational for me to think long-term again. Long-term
survival is never a sure thing for anyone, but cancer survivors feel a lot 
better every year after their fifth year of remission because even older 
survival numbers go up and to the right afterward.

Being asked something like ...  _where do you see yourself in a few years?_ in 
an interview no longer summons existential angst, which is a huge deal for me. 
I can rationally see myself building something long-term, not just contributing 
where I can to short-term needs while I waited to see how things went. 

I've filled in my time by doing some contract work to meet our minimum expenses, 
which has led me to amazing experiences I couldn't possibly have had otherwise. 
However, I want to contribute more than just content assignments; I'm not done 
making my mark on DevRel. 

I've been in language-agnostic roles for years; I helped to implement Stack Overflow's
now famous remote-first work culture for the community growth team, I have 
oodles of management experience and I'm a pretty darn nice guy. I've also got 
a <a href="/stack">pretty capable studio</a>. 

## So, What do I want to do?

I want to help mentor the next age of DevRel pros. I want to bring everything I have 
learned from running the world's hugest developer community together with my love for 
helping people find their own voice and confidence on their feet. I want to direct 
content, sure, but I want to teach others _how_ that process works. 

I also sorely miss the art of community building and management. And, well, I miss
longer-term relationships in general, which feels a bit lacking when you're just 
an outside contractor.  

## What do I want out of it?

What I need from an employer:

 - Remote-first culture
 - Flexible time. For tons of reasons.
 - Insurance that isn't a pain in the ass.
 - Rapid / fast-pace is great! Hyper-growth death marches, not so great.
 - Some kind of PTO program.
 - Commitment to a long-term DevRel program. I can be a one-person band, 
 but for months, not years.

I'm disabled; I'm always going to need to take frequent breaks during the day, 
I'll always need assistive technology and my immune system prevents frequent travel. 

Do you know someone? Please send them to me, or me to them!
