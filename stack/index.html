Once you get an audio interface, it will just lead to more audio interfaces. Primarily, I use the interface in the Xenyx, along with some by ART, PreSonus and others by Berhringer. It depends on the application.</p><p>I respect legendary microphones, but legendary mics don&#x27;t automatically create pleasant tracks. For both vocals and sound design, I use mics that have the properties I need, and they frequently don&#x27;t cost very much. I have mics from the following:</p><ul><li>Shure (SM7)</li><li>Samson (Dynamic &amp; Broadcast)</li><li>MXL Ribbon &amp; Cardiod</li><li>Neumann Cardiod (old)</li><li>Audix Leveler Mics</li><li>Rode shotgun &amp; lav mics (for video)</li></ul><p>Interfaces can be where audio becomes a rather expensive hobby / job. ART, FocusRite, PreSonus and Behringer make great interfaces that have very capable and universal mic preamps, as well as lots of connectivity options. Unless you&#x27;re doing multi-track recording, you don&#x27;t need more than a two-channel interface.</p><p>Preamps can be another temptation that hit your wallet hard. I like tube preamps, but solid-state preamps are great too! I never get an amp unless I have a specific need and goal for it. When I get them, I try to make sure they have high / low pass filters, phase reverse and phantom power so they&#x27;re useful in many settings.</p><p>As a general rule, I won&#x27;t spend more than $500 (usually way less) on any single thing, microphones included. While there have been some exceptions to this, I&#x27;ve acquired most of what I have through sheer luck, and knowing how to win on Ebay.</p><p class="margin-bottom--xl">You could get all of this virtually with one purchase of Pro Tools (which I don&#x27;t use). I like the feel and sound of the tube effects, and quirks of each mic and interface. All in, it would cost less than $5k to replace all of this stuff, FX included, and you&#x27;d save lots of room if you went 100% digital. I cling to an older era.</p></div></div></div></section></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Find Me On ...</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/50049/tim-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/tinkertim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/tinkertim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-post28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">LinkedIn<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Tim Post.
