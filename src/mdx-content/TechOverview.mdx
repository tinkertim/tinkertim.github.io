<TabItem value="languages" label="Languages" attributes={{className: styles.red}}>

I have used other languages, and even demonstrated things with them, but being able to 
demonstrate something is very different from developing with it daily. Rust is on my list 
to learn, and I plan to ramp up more with TypeScript soon. 

| Language | Experience Level | Last Used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | Advanced / Expert | Recently | C is my primary (and first serious) language. Most of my major contributions in open source have been in C (Linux, Xen, HelenOS, Ext3Cow) and almost all of my IoT stuff is C. |
| C++ | Beginner | A Year Ago | I can navigate C++ and understand it; I'm just very slow |
| PHP | Advanced | 4 Years Ago | I haven't used most of the new stuff in PHP8 yet. |
| Python | Mid-Level | 2 Years Ago | I write shell scripts with Python, mostly. |
| Perl | Mid-Level | 5 Years Ago | I used to reach for Perl before learning Python |
| JavaScript | Intermediate | Recently | I like developing with Deno and Node (more Deno than Node these days, which is great) |
| TypeScript | Intermediate | Recently | See JS notes |

<TabItem value="frameworks" label="Frameworks" attributes={{className: styles.orange}}>

I'm not particular when it comes to frameworks; all of them are great for different things. 
Well, most of them, anyway. Most of my web work goes into documentation sites or marketing
landing pages, and I lean heavily on React-based frameworks for that.

But that doesn't mean I don't stay up-to-date, in fact, I play with new frameworks as a 
hobby when time permits. 

| Framework | Experience Level | Last Used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| React-flavored | Mid-Level | Recently | I'm extremely familiar with content-focused frameworks, less so on media-focused. But, as long as the documentation is half-decent, I can jump in (React is React, JS is JS, TS is TS ..) |
| Preact-flavored | Beginner | Recently | Fresh is my most recent Preact-based framework |
| PHP-MVC | Intermediate | 2 Years Ago | I can use most MVC-oriented PHP frameworks and components. |
| Wordpress | Advanced | 2 Years Ago | I've written plugins. I'm not an expert, but I know it well. |
| Netlify CMS | Intermediate | 1 Year Ago | I'd honestly rather use MDX and a text editor. |

<TabItem value="environments" label="Environments" attributes={{className: styles.brown}}>

I'm comfortable developing *for* UNIX-like operating systems on any GNU/Linux distro, MacOS, 
ChromeOS or Windows. I have specific experience packaging software for `.rpm` and `.deb` based distros. I'm very 
comfortable with containers. Clusters are expensive, so I don't get to play with them as much as I'd like, but I've set 
them up on GCP and Digital Ocean. I love working on embedded systems. 

| Platform | Experience | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux/GNU & Linux/Custom | Expert | I've written device drivers for Linux. Debian GNU/Linux is my primary dev OS. I've maintained both .deb and .rpm packages, and am very familiar with many distros. |
| BSD & BSD-Like | Intermediate | I can develop for and on BSD systems, but not as fast as on / for Linux/GNU |
| Xen | Advanced | I've been following Xen since the very early days and have contributed to the Xen ecosystem / userland |
| Windows | Intermediate | I'm a power user, and I'm comfortable developing on Windows. |
| MacOS | Advanced | Mac & ChromeOS are my main desktop operating systems |
| ChromeOS | Advanced | See note about MacOS |
| Android | Intermediate | Power User |
| iOS / iPadOS | Intermediate | Power User |
| Kubernetes | Intermediate | I wish I could play with k8s more, but clusters are expensive. |
| C-Panel | Intermediate | I'm familiar with most web hosting automation software.

And this is where we dive into the stuff that doesn't fit neatly into the other tables! Think 
of this like a key-value reference. If it's not here and you're curious about it, hit me up! As 
far as new stuff goes, I'm currently learning more about EBPF and the sorts of things you can 
do with it.

| What is it? | How / Why do I use it? |
| --- | --- |
| Supabase | For storage on personal projects when I need SQL across languages. |
| Redis | Caching, KV, monitoring, broadcast and KV store |
| Configu | Managing configurations (integrates with all secret managers) |
| MongoDB Atlas | Storage for serverless / edge. Feeds workers. |
| IPFS (Filebase.com) | CDN with simple S3-compatible API |
| Code (VSCode) | My favorite editor / IDE |
| Docusaurus | Documentation sites / personal sites |
| Valgrind | Memory profiler / leak finder |
| GDB | General debugger of choice. |  
| Movavi / Final Cut / iMovie | I use Movavi, Final Cut & iMovie for video work where I'm not doing a lot of text or animations. |
| Canva | I use Canva for most marketing-oriented design and editing things, and video editing. Canva is awesome. |
| Loom / Movavi | Screen recording (though the native OS recording utilities are almost good enough on their own now, so I mostly just use those since they don't slow down my system) |
| Vector3 / FL Studio / Lexis Audio | My main digital audio workstations, though I use a bunch of others. |
| OBS (Open Broadcast Studio) | For livestream broadcast / office hours |
