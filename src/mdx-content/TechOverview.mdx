<TabItem value="languages" label="Languages" attributes={{className: styles.red}}>

I have used other languages, and even demonstrated things with them, but being able to 
demonstrate something is very different from developing with it daily. Rust is on my list 
to learn, and I plan to ramp up more with TypeScript soon. 

| Language | Experience Level | Last Used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | Advanced / Expert | Recently | C is my primary (and first serious) language |
| C++ | Beginner | A Year Ago | I can navigate C++ and understand it; I'm just very slow |
| PHP | Advanced | 4 Years Ago | I haven't used most of the new stuff in PHP8 yet. |
| Python | Mid-Level | 2 Years Ago | I write shell scripts with Python, mostly. |
| Perl | Mid-Level | 5 Years Ago | I used to reach for Perl before learning Python |
| JavaScript | Mid-Level | Recently | I've done work for Deno in the past |
| TypeScript | Mid-Level | Recently | See JS notes |

<TabItem value="frameworks" label="Frameworks" attributes={{className: styles.orange}}>

I've used far more than is listed here, but not really enough for them to have been memorable. I'm 
always trying new React / Preact frameworks, particularly those that run on Deno (e.g. Fresh / Astro).

| Framework | Experience Level | Last Used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| React-flavored | Mid-Level | Recently | I'm extremely familiar with content-focused frameworks, less so on media-focused. |
| Preact-flavored | Beginner | Recently | I'm still juggling the whole island thing, but I can work with them. |
| Vue | Beginner | 2 Years Ago | Was more evaluating than seriously using |
| PHP-MVC | Mid-Level | 2 Years Ago | I can use most MVC-oriented PHP frameworks. |
| Wordpress | Advanced | 2 Years Ago | I've written plugins. I can use WP well. |

<TabItem value="environments" label="Environments" attributes={{className: styles.brown}}>

I'm comfortable developing *for* UNIX-like operating systems on any GNU/Linux distro, MacOS, 
ChromeOS or Windows.

I have specific experience packaging software for `.rpm` and `.deb` based distros. I'm very 
comfortable with containers.

Clusters are expensive, so I don't get to play with them as much as I'd like, but I've set 
them up on GCP and Digital Ocean.

I love working on embedded systems.

<TabItem value="tools" label="Tools / SAAS" attributes={{className: styles.orange}}>

Code (VSCode) is my main IDE. I also like KATE, Sublime Text, Nano and PHPStorm.

I use Valgrind for memory debugging and GDB for general debugging. I'm familiar with
most popular build systems.

My VCS of choice is Git, but I'm equally enamored with Mercurial. I've also used 
Subversion, Bazaar, CVS, Bitkeeper and others. 

I use Configu to manage configurations whenever possible, which is cool because it 
works with all the popular secret managers.

GitHub actions is my main CI server, however I like almost all of them.
